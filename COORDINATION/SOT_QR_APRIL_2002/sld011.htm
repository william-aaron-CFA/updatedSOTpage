<LI><H2>Real-time commanding was required to reposition the HRC door back to its "mostly-closed" position on 2002 March 22. 
</H2>
<UL>
<LI>This was a clean-up action following a daily-load commanded close while the door was already in the mostly-closed position.
<LI>Scripts used in checking the daily-load have been modified to clearly flag any future attempted double close or double open.
<LI>Command sequence definition to perform HRC door position clean-up  in the daily load following a safing action run of SCS 107 when the HRC door was open has been approved for use.
</UL></UL><UL>
<LI><H2>Tests using laboratory hardware to study the discrepancy in the HRC-S between the valid rate and the number of telemetered events (reported at last quarterly review) demonstrated that the problem lies in double counting of large amplitude events. The problem does not occur in the HRC-I due to differences in the event pulse shapes. We are working on possible correction methods.
</H2>

<LI><H2>In preparation for OFLS-10 release, we have reviewed the proposed update to the HRCMODE ODE and supplied a sample HRCMODE table in the new format to CSC for software testing.</H2>
