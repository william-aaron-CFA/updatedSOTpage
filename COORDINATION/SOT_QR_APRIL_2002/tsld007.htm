<LI>A new FEF has been developed for S3 @ -120 C which incorporates the improved interpolation around the Si-K edge.
<LI>Completed evaluation of new S3 -110 C matrix which demonstrates the new matrix is significantly better.
<LI>Evaluation of new matrices is underway.
<LI>Continue work on a new method of FEF and RMF generation which should reduce the amount of time and labor necessary to produce matrices for the CTI-corrected FI data.
<LI>Evaluating results of MIT team which indicates that the gain of the BI CCDs is a sensitive function of incident flux at low energies.  This raises a large issue of how one generates RMFs when the response depends on the incident flux in general.
<LI>SOT/SDS/DS are discussing implementation & possible software development for use with factorizing the response of CTI-corrected frontside chips into a no-CTI ideal CCD response and a CTI effect.  Two approaches were discussed:
<UL>
<LI>Fit the ideal CCD response as it is currently done, and involve with the CTI effect matrix; or
<LI>Interpolate the ideal CCD response (and CTI matrix) from smoothed versions of the MIT instrument simulator pulse height spectra.
</UL><LI>Work is proceeding on approach 1.
