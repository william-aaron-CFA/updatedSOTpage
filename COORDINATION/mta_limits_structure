There will be a limits data base. This will contain all limits at all times 

all entries in the data base should have the following form

MSID Yellow_low yellow_high Red_low Red_high time_effective_start  T_E_STOP

There are three types of limits:
survival - these come from the IPCL see file tlim.txt (swolk has a
        copy)  
operating - These are the same as survival unless otherwise specified.
                (this data base is expected to be used by V&V as well 
                  as MTA)
State dependent - these change often as spacecraft configuration 
        limits in this data base are the same as survival unless
        otherwise specified.  (i.e. when no limits are present here
        the limits default to the survival limits.

near the bottom, SCIOPS has its own version see MCD for that.
