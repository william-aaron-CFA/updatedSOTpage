<h1>M&TA STATUS -  (2000-Apr-24)</h1>

<!-- <h4>We have accomplished the major flight critical task.  Monitoring of all L0 data products.
</h4>

Now we have to more forward on the rest of our charter, monitoring
higher level data products, trending and fancy analysis.  We also have
to tighten up what we have done. -->

<ul> 
<li>  REALTIME : safemode
<li>  AP : OFF
<li>  the list of monitored values is ready to go SOT has been running
it for a month on RT with emails going out daily.  The issue is that
every time ACORN goes down, it "forgets" the spacecraft status and thus
will re-alert for an existing problem.  We need to devise a way to keep
the ACORN object alive as much as possible and slip it dump data on an
as available basis.  This suggest reading dump data into a UDP port.

<h3>CLOSED ISSUES L0 monitoring:</h3>
<UL>
<li> All actions specified in The  <a href="./rehearsal/ART.html"> ART
report </a> (items 1-12) are to be closed.


<li> MTA needs to properly handle the incoming quality flag.  i.e. 
data of bad quality should not be involved in limit checking, nor
should it be plotted nor should it make it into the final MTA static files.
UPDATE 1/13/99:         Status: Software updates to mta_check_limits to read and monitor
                 with quality considered are complete.  An issue
                 regarding the transfer of QUALITY to the output file is 
                 being resolved.
                 Expectations are for this upgrade to be in place for the 
                 R4CU1C release.
 
                 Software updates for image generation to handle the
                 quality column are in progress and expected to be in
                 place for the R4CU1C release.



<li> Enhancements to to autogenerated GIFs.
Jim has a short list of minor adjustments. -COMPLETED

<li> I expect to have dynamic limits active for the Dec 21 Rehearsal. If
we find errors we will have to deal with these.<BR>
         ISSUE:  Has been "broken" since the engineering data format
                 change.  Several mnemonics used to determine the system 
                 state changed name and/or type.<BR>
 
         STATUS:  RTB has modified the code to function with EST2 data.
                  The pipeline mta_monitor_state has been updated and
                  run on sample data.  Unit Test results can be found in:
 
<a href ="file:/stage/ascds_extra/staff/UDF/Sciops/mta/monitor/TestData/change030/outdata">                 
/stage/ascds_extra/staff/UDF/Sciops/mta/monitor/TestData/change030/outdata
</a>
 
                  The code is being merged to Daily today (1/13/1999).
                  After that, ops can run sample pipelines to the 
                  usual directory.
                  It will be incorporated in the Jan. 15, release
                  (R4CU1C)

<li> MTA data seeker 1.0 Completed (no arguments)

<li> Currently MTA STATUS files  match up 1 to 1 with engineering files.
This leads to lot of unmanagable files. 
It would be best if we could merge like files once 8 hours and  warehouse them 
to the archive once per day.
Appearently Kenny's group already has tools to merge and create proper headers.
So this really shouldn't be too hard.


<li> FITS HEADERS: MTA Status file headers are not ASC standard.
           One notable omission is the CONTENT keyword which is
           required for data archive/retrieve. SJW has written a
standardization of the<a href
="./fits_header.txt"> MTA fits
header</a> and <a href ="./fits_keywords.txt">file by file
keywords. </a>

<ul>
<li> FROM SJW 1/15/99:Now that I have laid out the FITS HEADERS, it would definetly be advantageous
to archive our status files (the HDU CLASS structure allows a lot of search 
capability, although it does not preclude the data seeker.)
The drawing I showed at the meeting Tuesday indicated this via the two arrows, 
one to warehouse the data and one to file the database tables.<p>

<!--That said, I do not put the Merging of the files on the same level as  
<!--getting the headers right.
<!--I expect to see the headers right by 2/15.  I spoke to Richard and he thinks 
<!--this is doable. I suggest that Richard speak to Kenny about the extant
<!--fits header library as well as cfitsio.<p>
<li> <FONT COLOR=#FF00FF> READY TO PUT BACK 2/22/99 </FONT>

</ul>

<li>  Gradient Pipline<BR> Turned over!
<ul> 

<li>         ISSUES:  A minor issue is that actual gradient definitions
                  were only recently provided.  Evaluating the sources
                  of these MSIDs reveals that it is coming from multiple
                  engineering files, which is not what our original 
                  design expected ( EXTNAME not constant ).  Also, since
                  the input is L0 Engineering data, it may be subject
                  to variablility.
 
<li>         STATUS (1/13/99):  Definitions of gradient mnemonics have been provided. 
 
                  Priorities have not provided the time needed to evaluate
                  the redesign of the pipeline.  It may be an "execution"
                  change or code may need to be rewritten.
 
                  Serious memory leaks are causing the code to use
                  all available virtual memory.  This was not a problem
                  with the original definitions.  Work is under way to
                  track down and plug the leaks as time permits.
 
</ul>

<li>Reports from ASCDS indicate that it takes 
3 hours (!) to process 8 hours worth of Level 0 files. If this is accurate this
is very bad.
possible optimizations that I see:
<ul>
<li> setting the decom templates larger, I don't know how large they are set 
now,
but it could be as high as 30 minutes worth of data / eng file.

<li> opening only selected files.  We know what msids we want, therefore we can 
use the Xref to know the file names.  Instead of opening each file,
reading the column heading and comparing against the list, we could only 
open  files with data we were interested in and extract the data without 
interigating the file to verify the column's presence. 
</ul> 

</ol>
</UL>
<li> What is the status of running State and Static pipes in parallel?
<li> What is the status of getting the page times correct? 
<font color = 00FFFF> I think this is ready to put back</font>
<li> Who (whose software and whose operation) is responsible
	for archiving MTA Status files? How about the DB table data?
<font color = 00FFFF> This is done by AP </font>
<li> To what extent, can should cron jobs be employed instead of AP?
<li> What infrastructure tools (archival ingest, ACIS L0) exist, 
What need to be created?  Who will do it?

<li> How does the MTA DB ingestion occur
           as part of AP?  When is it kicked off?
<font color = 00FFFF> Part of ingest of files. </font>

<li> Photon_mon.  The current version is good as for as it goes (which
	is as far as the spec allows. ) Open issues include:
<ul>
<li> Photon_mon can't group L0 and L1 data since it groups by OBSID
(maybe do it by time? (priority 3)
<li> on M&TA ACIS/EVENT Event Report Page:<BR>

/proj/ascds/swolk/www/internal/xxxx.html (priority 5)

<li> ACIS team wants the L0 PHA plotted per readout node. DONE!
<li> ACIS team does not prefer  RAW_PHA(5) to be the only PHA plotted, but
they haven't proposed a more worthwhile alternative. (Priority 10)
<li> ACIS team wants the L1 EV, not PHA. (Priority 4)
<li> detect HRC/ACIS  hot spots and dead spots (this works with the dose
