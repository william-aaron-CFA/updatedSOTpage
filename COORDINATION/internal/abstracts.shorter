            1        3050 Auroral phenomena in Jupiter are diagnostic of the structure, processes and energetics of its magnetosphere. Past X-ray observations have revealed latitudinal and longitudinal asymmetries, with spectra consistent with a model of sulfur and oxygen ions precipitating onto the Jovian atmosphere. This observation will provide a clear image of the X-ray emission during a full Jovian rotational period with spectral resolution sufficient to detect the expected emission linesif ion precipitations powers the X-ray aurora. Galilean moons immersed in the magnetosphere may emit X-rays due to particle bombardment, auroral activity or other process.

          13        3069 We propose to obtain a single, 60 ksec, ACIS-I exposure of the core of the 100 million year-old Pleiades open cluster. The 16x16 arcmin ACIS-I field of view will contain at least 20 known ROSAT PSPC sources for which ACIS-I will provide simultaneous, high signal-to-noise 0.5-7 keV light curves and low-resolution spectra. The ACIS-I image will also reveal 100-200 previously unknown X-ray sources. Most will be associated with low-mass cluster members including a few candidate brown dwarfs. The ACIS data will be used with recently derived rotational periods to test rotation-activity at the low end of the zero-age main sequence. The ACIS spectra and light curves will allow modeling of X-ray flares and coronal heating for these young, active stars.
          14        3071 We propose to observe two active binaries with the AXAF HETGS and LETGS. TZ CrB is a G0 V + G0 V RS CVn binary. The HETGS observation will span an entire 1.14-d orbital period and will probably include one large flare. The HETGS line profiles may reveal high-velocity material ejected at the onset of a flare. Density and temperature-sensitive line ratios obtained at different orbital phases will be used to map the coronal geometry of TZ CrB. 44 Boo is an eclipsing, W UMa-type contact binary. The LETGS observation of 44 Boo will span no less than two 0.27-d orbital periods and will be used to perform coronal eclipse mapping and to investigate flares. Moreover, 44 Boo's maximum radial velocity separation of 230 km/s should be resolved in the longer wavelength LETG line profiles.

          16        3072 We propose to observe two active late-type single dwarfs with the AXAF HETGS. AB Dor is a Pleiades-age K2 V rapid rotator at a distance of 15 pc. AB Dor exhibits large-amplitude long-duration flares and rotationally modulated activity at many wavelengths. The HETGS observation of AB Dor will span an entire 0.51-d rotational period. AU Mic is a very active M1 V flare star at a distance of 10 pc. AB Dor and AU Mic are prototypes for extreme main-sequence magnetic activity. The principal objectives of the HETGS observations are (i) to obtain time-resolved X-ray spectra of flares and (ii) to obtain high signal-to-noise, high-resolution spectra of very hot coronal sources to test optically thin collisional ionization equilibrium plasma codes. Supporting ground-based observations are planned.

          18        3074 The Orion Trapezium cluster is the richest and densent cluster of pre-main sequence stars in the solar neighborhood, and the nearest region of high-mass star forming region. It is a superb laboratory for study of X-ray emission from protostars, classical and weak-lined T Tauri stars. The proposed observation should detect hundreds of stars, dozens of powerful magnetically-induced flares. X-ray emission from embedded protostars and massive OB stars will also be studied. The relationaships between X-ray emission and other stellar properties, and the influence of magnetic activity on star and planet formation, will be investigated.
          19        3075 Low-mass pre-main sequence stars from protostars to post-T Tauri stars have X-ray emission considerably above that seen in older stars. Powerful flares from Class I protostars are particularly important and poorly understood. The core of the nearby star forming cloud in Corona Australis contains several X-ray emitting protostars as well as T Tauri and Herbig Ae/Be stars with associated outflows.
          20        3077 The Orion molecular cloud contains a wide range of star forming environments, from rich high-mass clusters to distributed low-mass star formation. This observation focuses on the latter. The field includes a number of T Tauri stars, the Herbig Ae/Be star V380, and the high-velocity Herbig-Haro objects HH-1 and HH-2. Soft X-rays from the outflow, or hard Fe-K emission from a diffuse plasma, may also be detected. A short exposure will resolve the whether the B9 star HD 37001 or a nearby M4 star is responsible for the ROSAT source RX0535-0633.

          22        3078  30 Doradus is a bright star-forming region in the LMC.  It contains over 100 OB stars and has been observed to be a source of diffuse X-rays.  This AXAF observation will measure spectra of young stars and of the diffuse emission.   Energy balance and emission processes in the nebula will be studied.
          23        3080 Our proposed program to understand the X-ray emission from late-type stars will address three important issues: i) establish whether the ``solar analogy'' is invariably appropriate (and under what circumstance it may not apply), ii) determine coronal characteristics and their dependence on the properties of the underlaying stars (including rotation, color, and metallicity), and iii) understand the variation of activity levels at the low-mass end of the main sequence, where the convection zone may penetrate to near the stellar center.

          25        3081 These observations will investigate the origin of X-ray emission from early-type stars and seek to discriminate between existing models which can be grossly characterized as either ``coronal'' or ``shocked wind''. For the nearest examples of this stellar class, the HRC-I should be able to distinguish between X-ray emission from within the stellar wind ``bubble'' and that emanating from the surrounding interstellar medium. High resolution spectroscopic observations with the HRC-S+LETGS can determine the variation of the soft X-ray absorption as a function of bolometric luminosity, spectral type, and mass loss rate. This absorption holds the observational key to understanding the relative position of the X-ray source(s) and the ambient massive cool winds which emanate from OB stars.
          26        3082 Our observations of star formation regions and young compact clusters will address: i) stellar collapse and commencement of nuclear burning - associated high X-ray activity makes such observations one of the best techniques for selecting young stars in molecular clouds for detailed study; and ii) the question of the existence of the X-ray activity in low mass stars at the onset of full convection - the problem of conflicting evidence arising from studies of field M dwarfs can be addressed by observing young open clusters cores over a range of ages and by examining the behavior of Lx and Lx/L_bol with spectral type and/or rotation.

          30        3117 H1504+65 is the hottest white dwarf star known. Its atmosphere appears to be devoid of H or He, perhaps from mass loss during several cycles through the red giant phase. If so this star reveals directly the products of nuclear burning in the core of its progenitor. A high resolution spectrum can identify the elements in the photosphere. If present, the detection of Ne and its abundance will provide important information on the physical conditions in the core.

          75        3121 The standard model of supersoft X-ray sources (SSS)
          76        3122 RE0751+14 is the brightest of a new class of intermediate polars discovered by ROSAT. Its soft X-ray spectrum is dominated by a blackbody-like component with a temperature of about 50 eV, reminiscent of that seen in the strongly magnetic polars. In analogy the soft component probably originates from an accretion-heated surface region around the white dwarfs magnetic pole(s). We propose to do high resolution X-ray spectroscopy of RE0751+14 to investigate in detail the soft spectral component. Resolving spectral features will provide very valuable information on the emission mechanism and the white dwarf atmosphere. It will be vital to find the physical parameters which rule the production of the soft X-ray component in soft intermediate polars.
          77        3123 The standard model of supersoft X-ray sources (SSS)
          78        3124 We propose a deep ACIS-S observation of 47 Tuc to confirm and map our ROSAT discovery of diffuse emission from a probable bow shock and possible non-thermal emission from the large population of millisecond pulsars. The bow shock emission will be mapped out to 5-10arcmin from the peak diffuse emission and measure the proper motion of the cluster in the Galaxy. The spectral distribution will constrain both the mass loss of cluster stars and the temperature-density of the hot gas in the galactic halo. The possible IC emission from low energy CR electrons accelerated in the bow shock will constrain the MSP population and particle production in the cluster, while the spectra of point sources will complement and extend our deep HRC-I survey for CVs and dim x-ray sources in this key cluster.
          79        3125 We propose a deep initial study of the CV population and dim x-ray sources in two globular clusters, NGC 6397 and 47 Tuc. Both clusters have extensive dim (Lx ~ 10^31-33 erg/s) x-ray source populations which our ROSAT/HST studies have shown are likely dominated by CVs although the brightest sources in 47 Tuc may also include quiescent LMXBs. The HRC-I (47Tuc) and ACIS-S (NGC 6397) images will allow the luminosity function, variability, and source identifications (with planned HST followup) to be measured and constraints on the origin of cluster WDs and NSs as well as compact binaries in these two contrasting globulars (differing in metallicity, halo vs. disk, and mass) to be derived. A complementary ACIS-S study of 47Tuc will measure spectra of both dim sources and the diffuse emission.
          80        3128 The nature of a large subset of luminous supersoft X-ray sources (SSSs) has not yet been established. Although they are thought to be white dwarfs steadily burning accreted matter, there is no definitive evidence that this picture is correct: in particular we do not have direct evidence that any of the systems contain an accreting white dwarf. The observations we propose will provide good spectral information for all of the SSSs that are candidates for the nuclear-burning white dwarf model. We will be able to extract values of the temperature, luminosity and N_H, and to see evidence of absorption edges that may be associated with the white dwarf's atmosphere.

          87        3133 We propose to use Cyg X-2 as a bright 'candle' behind a sufficient dense column of interstellar matter in order to study absorption and scattering effects. Energy resolved scattering halos provide a clue to the chemistry of interstellar dust including the question if grains have a Silicate core and an organic mantle. Since haloes are not completely observable with a dispersive instrument, we will use the brightness distribution in cross dispersion direction for measuring the energy dependent scattering cross section. Cyg X-2 is the brightest among reasonably absorbed sources (NH > 10**21 cm**-2). We expect about 18 cts/s with HRC-S + LETG more than 500.000 cts within a 30ksec observation, respectively.
          88        3136 Study of the X-ray scattered halo around obscured Galactic X-ray sources can provide insights into the size, density, composition and spatial distribution of interstellar grains. Eclipsing X-ray binary systems offer unique advantages, as the evolution of the halo following an abrupt eclipse depends on the distance and distribution of clouds. A high-resolution spectrum will further provide rich information on the interstellar matter composition.

          92        3140 WE PROPOSE TO CARRY OUT A SYSTEMATIC STUDY OF EMISSION AND ABSORPTION SPECTRAL FEATURES THAT ARE OFTEN SEEN IN X-RAY SPECTRA OF BLACK HOLE BINARIES.  THE EXCELLENT SENSITIVITY AND ENERGY RESOLUTION OF THE ACIS/HETG COMBINATION WILL NOT ONLY HELP RESOLVE AMBIGUITIES IN INTERPRETING THESE FEATURES, BUT MAY ALLOW MODELLING OF THE EMISSION LINE PROFILES IN DETAIL.  THE PROFILES MAY CONTAIN INFORMATION ON SUCH FUNDAMENTAL PROPERTIES AS THE SPIN OF BLACK HOLES.  THEREFORE, THIS STUDY COULD LEAD TO A MEASUREMENT OF BLACK HOLE SPIN FOR SELECTED SOURCES. THE RESULT CAN THEN BE DIRECTLY COMPARED WITH THOSE FROM PREVIOUS STUDIES BASED ON INDEPENDENT METHODS.

          95        3143 Comparisons of the luminosities of Black Hole (BH) and Neutron Star X-ray Nova (XN) provide the first direct observational evidence that black holes have event horizons. Central to the interpretation of this evidence is the understanding of the accretion flow in X-ray Nova as Advection Dominated Accretion Flows (ADAFs) when the systems are "quiescent". These observations will allow qualitative improvement in our ability to test the ADAF (or any other) model by providing the second high-quality spectrum of a quiescent BHXN, and the first high-quality spectrum of a short-period BHXN.

This prototype for the double degenerate binaries is bright enough to obtain high S/N spectra with the LETG such that phase-resolved spectra can neasure the abundances in this extreme example of stellar/binary evolution as well as provice the first measure of a NS mass in an actively accreting LMXB in a globular. Comparison with statistical measures will allow constraints on both cluster potential and formation and evolution of thsi exotic system.

         108        3156 Her X-1 is a neutron star in a binary system, accreting matter from its stellar companion. The X-ray emission is modulated with the 1.24 s spin period of the neutron star, the 1.7 d orbital period and an additional 35 d cycle. The hard X-ray pulses of the neutron star irradiate plasma trapped in its magnetosphere, where they are partially absorbed and re-emitted at energies less than 1 keV. We propose to utilize the high spectral resolving power of the AXAF LETG for detailed phase-resolved spectral studies of the soft X-ray radiation during the 35 d on-state. The observation should start shortly before eclipse egress, when the X-rays of the neutron star are penetrating the atmosphere of the stellar companion, to get also information on its structure and ionisation stage.
         109        3157 This is an observation of the dust-scattered halo from a bright, strongly-absorbed source.

         113        3161 The very soft (57 eV blackbody) and very bright (3.67 ROSAT PSPC cts/sec) ROSAT source RXJ1856.5-3754 was identified recently by HST as a near-by, isolated, old, non-pulsating neutron star. The PSPC spectral blackbody fit indicates a low absorbing column density (correponding to A_V below 0.1 mag), so that this object most certainly is foreground to the R CrA dark cloud at 130 pc. With the LETG spectrum, we plan to perform photospheric spectroscopy, i.e. to check for deviations from a blackbody, e.g. due to a cyclotron emission feature in the Wien tail, or either a H, He, or Fe atmosphere. From the PSPC count rate, we can estimate that a 50 ksec AXAF LETG observation will provide sufficient S/N for distinguishing between these alternatives.
         114        3162 We will perform a deep ACIS observation of Cas A. The goals of the observation are to: 1. Produce a broad band map to AXAF's 0.5" intrinsic resolution. 2. Obtain a hard band continuum map with sufficient signal-to-noise to determine the morphology of the synchrotron radiation from the shell. 3. Map out emission from Si, S, Fe lines; look for clumps, or evidence of stratification. 4. Create detailed Doppler map. 5. Measure the expansion rate of the X-ray gas by comparison with ROSAT images. 6. Search for neutron star remnant.
         115        3163 We will perform deep ACIS-I observations of the young SNR's Tycho and Kepler. The goals of these observations are to: 1.

Provide a baseline for proper motion studies. For Tycho, additional goals are: 4. Isolate and characterize the spectrum of the blast wave. 5. Measure the flux and spectrum of the hard tail.

         117        3165 We will perform a 50 ks observation of the supernova remnant W49B using ACIS-I. The goals of this observation are as follows: 1. Measure the flux and spectrum of the hard tail. 2. Map out the emission from Si, S, Fe and thereby search for the stratification suggested by ASCA. 3. Determine progenitor type by measuring relative abundances of observable metals. 4.Obtain the first high spatial resolution, broad band image. 5. Map temperature and ionization structure
         118        3166 We will perform ACIS-I observations of some of the bright, young supernova remnants in the Magellanic Clouds. Two of these, 0519-69.0 and N103B have Type Ia progenitors; the other two, E0102-72 and 0540-69.3 are the results of core collapse explosions. For 0519-67.5, 0102-72, and N103B, our goals are: i. Measure nucleosynthesis yields via spectral fitting. ii. Look for evidence of stratification and ionization variation via high resolution, narrow band maps. For 0540-69.3, are goals are: i.) Obtain spatially resolved spectrum of the shell, and search for enhanced abundances of Type II nucleosynthesis products. ii.) Measure the extent of the central plerion.

         120        3169 E0102-72 and N132D are the brightest remnants in the SMC and LMC (respectively) and are the best SNR candidates for grating observations as they are distant enough to subtend a small angular size yet bright enough to allow reasonable integration times. The ASCA spectrum of E0102-72 shows lines of He-like emission from O, Ne, and Mg. The line ratios of these elements cannot be explained using models with uniform abundances. Previous high-resolution studies of N132D using the Einstein Focal Plane Crystal Spectrometer (FPCS) have shown an oxygen overabundance. We plan to use plasma diagnostics of individual emmission lines to map the temperature, ionization and abundance structures of these two remnants.

         122        3170 Over the next decade, the shock front from the supernova explosion SN 1987A in the Large Magellanic Cloud will interact with a comlex environment. The X-ray emission is likely to brighten and change in various ways as the shock encounters the dense ring, HII region and red giant wind. Regular monitoring of the source throughout the duration of the AXAF mission is needed to test models of remnant evolution, nonequilibrium ionization processes and elemental abundances.
         123        3171 The Galactic supernova remnant RCW 103 contains a central object that appears to be a member of the class of radio silent neutron stars. ASCA observations show that it has a temperature that could be as high as 7 million degrees, making it the hottest surface seen so far. The data from ASCA are difficult to interpret unambiguously, however, because the neutron star is not well separated from the diffuse emission. This ACIS observation will clearly resolve the neutron star and determine its surface temperature.
         124        3172 The nearby supernova SN 1987A provides an unprecedented opportunity to study the formation of a supernova remnant as the supernova shock front interacts with the surrounding circumstellar medium. The spectrum obtained here should give unique information concerning the physical conditions, composition and (through Doppler broadening) bulk velocity of the X-ray emitting gas. Repeated observations through the duration of the AXAF mission will trace the complex evolution of the shock.
         125        3173 N103B = SNR 509.0-68.7, one of the radio and X-ray brightest supernova remnants (SNRs) in the LMC, is a remnant of a Type Ia supernova explosion (carbon deflagration of a white dwarf). One side encounters a giant HII complex while the other side is freely expanding. With a known distance and low absorption, it provides an excellent oportunity to explore early SNR evolution. This ACIS observation will give spatially-resolved spectra. The elemental abundances and ionization state of the bright X-ray clumps (ejecta?) will be resolved from the more diffuse shell (blast wave?) emission.
         126        3174 G292.0+1.8, one of the radio-brightest supernova remnants (SNRs) in the sky, has a shell-type exterior with a plerionic core. Optical high-velocity O- and Ne-rich filaments are seen near the center. The X-ray morphology is also composite with a large barlike structure bisecting the shell. The X-ray spectrum shows both a non-equilibrium ionized plasma with excess metal abundances expected from a 25 solar mass progenitor, and a hard power-law component likely associated with the central synchrotron nebula. This ACIS image will elucidate the spatial distribution of elemental excesses, study dynamics of the X-ray bar with Doppler shifts, and confirm the presence of a nonthermal nebula.
         127        3175 The pulsar PSR B0833-45 inside the Vela supernova remnant is the youngest and brightest source of thermal X-ray radiation from a neutron star. It thus provides an important laboratory for study of several expected components: continuous soft thermal X-ray emission from the cooling neutron star surface, pulsed hard thermal X-rays from the hot magnetic polar caps, and absorption features from the highly magnetized atmosphere. This observation will resolve the Vela pulsar from the surrounding synchrotron nebula, and give a high resolution spectrum that may reveal the chemical composition of its outer layers, its surface magnetic field, mass/radius ratio, and polar cap properties. The HRC detector is used to obtain spectra at different phases within the 89 ms rotational period.

         130        3265 We propose to observe two isolated neutron stars which are known to be pulsars at other wavelengths and are moderately strong X-ray sources. The objective is to observe spectral absorption features due to Fe atoms in the stellar atmosphere. The locations and strengths of the absorption features will be determined in large part by the strength and orientation of the magnetic field at the neutron surface. The features will be modulated as the star rotates, so we desire to measure the spectrum as a function of pulse phase.

         168        3193 The spectrum of the Crab nebula and pulsar have been studied by virtually every X-ray astronomy mission in the last 20 years.

         240        3268 We propose to observe two elliptical galaxies NGC1399 and NGC4486 with the HETGS. Hot gas trapped in the potential well of elliptical galaxies is known to emit X-rays with a temperature that is characteristic of the depth of the potential. Cool (~1 keV) X-ray plasmas are rich in emission lines which will allow us to determine the physical state of the ISM. The temperature and abundance of the hot gas will be determined. The relative abundances of Fe and the alpha-process elements will allow us to determine the relative rate of Type I & Type II SNe supernova. In addition, X-ray emission from any nuclear sources will also be examined.

         242        3269 The Galactic Center is an extremely complex region with extremely high stellar densities, high-mass star formation, highly sheared motions and magnetic fields, and probably a massive black hole. Past X-ray observations have not had sufficient resolution or sensitivity to clearly discriminate the various emitting structures. This ACIS observation has the high energy response to penetrate the large column densities, the resolution to achieve extremely high sensitivity to an active galactic nucleus and detect a variety of stellar sources.

         315        3282 We will obtain an ACIS-S spectral image of the Antennae (NGC4038/NGC4039). This interacting galaxy pair shows complex ROSAT HRI emission, and contains 12 sources. ASCA shows that at least two spectral components are present. ACIS-S spectra and imaging will determine the nature of these sources and of the diffuse emission. This exposure will give 500 counts in each HRI source, sufficient for a spectrum.
         316        3283 NGC5128, the host galaxy of the Cen A, is the nearest elliptical galaxy, and the only one in which individual binary X-ray sources can be detected (and then only by AXAF). This allows a unique way to discriminate the hot ISM from the binary source contribution to elliptical galaxy emission. The absorption of the nuclear spectrum by the dust lane will provide diagnostics of the composition and ionization state of the absorber. The X-ray/radio jet is the closest powerful example of its kind. A detailed X-ray map will explicate jet physics, and will again serve to study the galaxy ISM through the jet interaction.

         327        3295 M81, a grand-design spiral, has a nuclear source and distinct spiral arms. It has about the same mass as the Milky Way and several bright X-ray sources are associated with the bulge and spiral arms. This is a demonstration of typical spiral-galaxy X-ray structure. The contrast between optical and X-ray pictures should be striking.
         328        3296 Within a 30 day ROSAT HRI monitoring observations we have detected the strongest persistent X-ray variability known in a Seyfert galaxy. At least 5 giant amplitude variations with a factor of about 60 are visible. Unusually strong relativistic boosting effects provide the most plausible explanation of the X-ray data. We propose to use AXAF for a precise measurement of the position of the source of the strong variability to further proof that the X-rays we measure are associated with the distant galaxy. We expect about 500 HRC photons within 10 ks observing time. We may further improve the HRG position using serendipitous X-ray sources detected previously with the HRI that have counterparts in the Optical.

Hot gas can be associated with hot radiatively driven winds, shocks driven by mass outflow or cooling accretion flows.

         361        3329 M82 is the prototype starburst galaxy, the closest galaxy with L(FIR)>L(V). Its inner kpc is experiencing a violent episode of star formation with a top-heavy initial mass function following a recent passage by M81. The result is a rich complex of OB stars, giant HII regions, supernovae and supernova remnants all driving a hot galactic wind. This observation should detect and resolve a considerable number of supernovae, young remnants, OB star clusters and X-ray binaries in addition to the X-ray luminous hot interstellar medium.

         373        3336 The X-ray spectra of Seyfert galaxies can be very complex with combinations of thermal emission from the accretion disk, Compton upscattering of disk photons, Compton reflection continuum, nonthermal jet continuum, ultrasolf component, neutral and ionized absorbers. This study concentrates on high resolution spectroscopy of one bright Seyfert 1 (NGC 3783) and one bright Seyfert 2 (Circinus galaxy). NGC 3783 is a particularly good laboratory for study of the ionized `warm absorbers' in AGNs; numerous absorption edges are expected which will strongly constrain the geometry of material around the AGN. Circinus is expected to show a rich emission line spectrum superposed on a reflection continuum.

         375        3339 We will obtain ACIS-S spectra of quasars at high redshifts to investigate their: emission spectra to ~30keV (rest); Fe-K emission; low energy cut-offs. A search for extended emission around the quasars will limit any hot atmosphere associated with the surrounding galaxy/cluster in formation. PKS2126-158 is the brightest of the absorbed high z quasars. HE1104-1805 is a radio quiet quasar lensed to be bright. The lens contains a damped Lyman-alpha absorber that should affect the X-ray spectrum, and the two lens components are readily resolved by AXAF at 3 arcsec separation.

         377        3340 B2 0738+313 is a Gigahertz Peaked Spectrum (GPS) radio source. Our ROSAT HRI observations show that the X-ray source is extended. This probably indicates a group or cluster of galaxies with a hot ICM is present. Such a high pressure environment may limit the expansion of the radio source and may cause its low frequency absorption. An AXAF image will allow the determination of the properties of this environment- scale size, temperature, pressure - separately from the quasar emission.

This observation of an X-ray-bright cluster at z = 0.83 will give insight into the mass, temperature and metal distribution of the medium at an early epoch, as well as measurement of the gravitational potential.
         513        3460 ROSAT PSPC image of A3667 suggests a shock wave located to the South-East of the cluster center. The X-ray surface brightness drops by a factor of 5 within 1' across the shock; the Hugoniot adiabat predicts a 50% temperature drop. A 100 ksec ACIS-I observation would enable an accurate measurement of the shock temperature profile (~1keV accuracy will be achieved in 15"x4.5' strips along the shock). The shock density profile will be resolved because the free path of electrons,15 kpc, corresponds to 10" at the cluster redshift. Important information about the ICM can be derived from these observations. For example, shaper shocks with milder temperature drop are expected if the magnetic fields are dynamically important.
         514        3461 A1367 is a unique cluster with multiple "clumps" first observed with the Einstein Observatory and then with ROSAT. Some of these clumps appear to be coincident with cluster galaxies, others do not. A high resolution image with CCD energy resolution will help determine what these clumps really are.
         515        3462 Clusters of galaxies are large gravitationally bound systems dominated by dark matter (DM). The amount and spatial distribution of DM in clusters are keys to understanding the development of cosmic structure and cosmography. The gravitational potential of clusters observed here can been mapped in various ways: strong or weak gravitational lensing of background galaxies, Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect, and X-ray gas hydrostatic equilibrium. ACIS will measure the cluster X-ray surface brightness and temperature profiles, detect nonuniformities and substructure that will signficantly improve our understanding of their DM distribution.

         579        3514 We will perform a Deep Survey of the Lockman Hole to a depth of 1x10^-16 erg/cm^2/sec. Of order 400 sources are expected to be detected within the HRC "good" filed of view, and the CXRB may be fully resolved. The HRC-I provides accurate positions and extent information for the sources. Identifications should be unambiguous through correlations at other wavelengths. Existing questions about the contributions of NLXGs to the background should be resolved.
         580        3515 This observation of the X-ray background will achieve unprecedented sensitivity to faint X-ray sources, particularly in the 2-10 keV band. Source counts and arcsecond positions for several hundred sources will be obtained with spectra and variability for the stronger sources. Combined with the superb optical images and spectroscopy available for the Hubble Deep Field and flanking fields, and new spectroscopy where needed, this study should considerably elucidate the composition and astrophysics of the high-energy cosmic background radiation.

         583         962 The recent discovery of unexpectedly bright X-ray emission from comets has led to increased interest in X-ray studies of solar system objects. It has demonstrated that even in our immediate astronomical environment surprises may be waiting for being discovered. With their carbon and oxygen rich atmospheres and the absence of strong magnetic fields, Venus and Mars represent the closest planetary analogues to comets. Soft X-ray observations provide a sensitive tool to study such atmospheres, in particular any outgassing effects. AXAF is the first imaging X-ray satellite which is able to observe Venus, and Mars at opposition, when it is closest to Earth.
         584        1013 The discovery of x-ray emission from comets has produced a number of questions about the physical mechanism producing the radiation. There are now a variety of explanations for the emission, from thermal bremsstrahlung of electrons off neutrals or dust, to charge exchange induced emission from solar wind ions, to reconnection of solar magnetic field lines. In an effort to understand this new phenomenon, we propose spectroscopic and imaging photometric observations with the AXAF ACIS-S of periodic comet P/Tempel 2 during its close approach to Earth in 1999. Our scientific goal is to determine the mechanism(s) responsible for the observed x-rays by producing detailed low energy spectra, high spatial resolution images, hardness maps of the emission.

         587        1031 Certain planetary nebulae (PNe) are X-ray sources. Although this emission is generally ascribed to central stars, PNe also should display hot (> 10^6 K), diffuse X-ray emission, according to the "interacting winds" model of PN evolution. With the unprecedented combination of spatial and spectral resolution afforded by AXAF/ACIS we will, for the first time, distinguish unambiguously between diffuse, nebular X-ray emission and emission from the central star. We propose to observe 4 PNe that, based on previous ROSAT and ASCA results, are likely to display extended, high-temperature X-ray emission in ACIS images and spectra. These data will provide constraints on PN X-ray emission models and on the excitation of H_2 emission from PNe.

         589        2451 We propose to obtain AXAF/LETGS spectra of K- and L-shell absorption edges and scattering halos due to dust along the line of sight to X Persei. These data, along with our existing HST/GHRS results on gas in the same line of sight, will provide direct information on grain composition and sizes. The combination of AXAF and HST data will provide new insights into depletions (independent of any assume "cosmic" abundances), and will provide important new constraints on models for the dust as well as the relationship between stellar and ISM compositions. X Per is a reddened power-law source with a steep high-energy cut-off, making it an ideal candidate (with minimal confusion due to high spectral orders), with sufficient flux to achieve S/N of about 25 in 50 ksec.
         590        2727 The unprecedented spectroscopic and imaging capabilities of AXAF are well suited to solving the puzzle of cometary x-ray origin. In addition, the heliocentric and geocentric distance of Comet 10P/Tempel 2 in August 1999 will make it an ideal subject for x-ray study. We therefore propose a 50 ksec observation of Tempel 2 with HRC-S/LETG that will allow us to test unambiguously the spectral predictions of the leading models for generation of cometary x-rays. We also request a 25 ksec imaging observation with HRC-I to determine the morphology of the cometary emission. These observations, in conjunction with our campaign of multiwavelength observations, will allow us to test all the proposed models for cometary x-ray emission.

         592        2919 AXAF imaging and spectroscopic TOO observations of six (6) gamma-ray burst afterglow sources are proposed. Initial source localizations will be provided by the RXTE/ASM and HETE satellites, supplemented by IPN measurements. AXAF measurements will not only provide arc-second refinements of source localizations, but will accurately measure afterglow decay and spectra, permitting stringent tests of a variety of shock wave geometries and sequelae. The observing team will immediately place all AXAF positions, intensities, and spectroscopic parameters into the public domain via the GCN. Prompt optical (photometric and spectroscopic) and radio followup will also be provided by the proposing team.

         596        3018 BeppoSAX recently discovered X-ray transients associated with gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), leading to reliable identification of the GRB hosts and astrophysical constraints of the evolution of GRB events. Fundamental advances in understanding GRBs can be achieved with the arcsecond positions, high sensitivity and spectral calpabilities of AXAF/ACIS. Our TOO program will permit: (1) fast counterpart identification at other wavelengths; (2) study of the afterglow spectrum and evolution in both the early (days) and late (months) phases; and (3) possible detection of X-ray line features. We propose to study 6 bursts localized by BeppoSAX or RXTE, selecting two of the brightest for detailed multiepoch spectral study.

         604         860 Previous low- and moderate-resolution X-ray spectroscopy of active binary stars have yielded surprising results concerning the abundances of the elements in these coronal plasmas, viz., that, in almost every well-studied case, a solar photospheric abundance plasma model cannot fit the observed spectrum: e.g., in some stars, Fe abundances of 10% of the solar value have been inferred. To verify and extend these findings, we propose to observe with the HETG two of the best-studied such stars, Algol and UX Ari. We will study the detailed structure of the He-like multiplets of the abundant elements O, Ne, Mg, Si, S, Ar, Ca, and Fe, and rederive their abundances, and also search for anomalous line ratios due to effects such as high resonance-line opacity and/or high electron densities.

         606         892 We propose to obtain a 50 ksec ACIS-I observation of the young stellar cluster IC 348. The high sensitivity and spatial resolution of AXAF/ACIS will allow us, for the first time, to detect X-ray emission from the numerous faint T Tauri stars in IC 348. This will enable us to identify the {\bf full} population of T Tauri stars in IC 348, i.e.~down to stellar masses of $0.1\,M_\odot$, by their X-ray emission. Furthermore, this observation will provide us with X-ray spectra and lightcurves for a large $(\ge 200)$ and homogeneous sample of T Tauri stars.
         607         914 Colliding stellar winds in early-type binary systems produce a complex region of shock-heated plasma with temperatures in excess of 10^7 K, with the strongest X-ray emission from systems containing Wolf-Rayet (WR) stars. Only in X-rays do we directly see the shocked gas from the wind collision. Recent high spatial resolution radio observations of WR 147 have revealed two sources 0.6" apart, which are believed to be the WR-star and the wind collision shock, both of which will be X-ray sources. These two sources will be resolvable in a 5ksec observation with the HRC-I. This observation will provide the first direct imaging of hot shocked gas in an early-type binary, unambiguously verifying that the enhanced X-ray emission in early-type binaries is due to a colliding winds shock.
         608         969 We propose the spectroscopic observation of the very hot, hydrogen-rich central stars of the planetary nebulae NGC 1360 and NGC 6853. These are the brightest of four objects of this spectral subtype which were detected in the EUVE all-sky survey. Both were detected also by ROSAT. The high-resolution AXAF spectra will be analyzed together with high-resolution high-S/N optical, ultraviolet (IUE), extreme ultraviolet(EUVE), and X-ray (ROSAT) data by means of fully metal-line blanketed NLTE model atmospheres. Principal aim of the AXAF observations is the first comprehensive determination of light metal (Li - Ca) abundances as well as of iron group element abundances in central stars of planetary nebulae.
         609        1092 AXAF/HETG spectra of the RS CVn binary, Lambda And, will probe the temperature and density of an unusually hot corona, whose structure has been outlined through extreme ultraviolet and X-ray studies. Lambda And provides an important link for understanding the activity/rotation relation, showing evidence in the photosphere for both high latitude and equatorial spots. The proposed AXAF grating observation will quantify the coronal emission measure distribution over the full temperature range, electron densities for at least two distinct temperatures, and elemental abundances needed to calculate radiative losses. Coronal abundances from high and low First Ionization Potential will be measured and compared with well known photospheric abundances.
         610        1123 For almost 20 years we have been trying to determine the source of the X-ray emission in OB stars. It is generally believed that this emission is caused by a distribution of stellar wind shocks. The AXAF grating spectrometers will provide the ultimate test of X-ray models. The shock model predicts that X-ray lines must be Doppler blue-shifted, hence, our primary objective is to measure these blue-shifts. MARX simulations show that the expected X-ray line shifts will be at least 4 times the MEG1 energy resolution limit. ASCA observations have provided stronger constraints on X-ray models, but they have also raised additional questions (e.g., X-ray abundance anomalies). The large number of X-ray lines predicted by MARX simulations will allow us to probe X-ray densities and abundances.
         611        1124 We propose to obtain images and spectra for the massive star formation regions (MSFRs) W3, G5.89, and G34.26 using the ACIS-I detector on AXAF. Our goals are to determine how common X-ray emission is from MSFRs and if the emission is generally extended and as hard as that observed toward W3. Further, we wish to use the high spatial resolution of AXAF to resolve the individual UC HII regions in the W3 complex. Observations of G5.89 and G34.26 will address the issues of how common extended, hard X-ray emission is from MSFRs, determine if FeXXV line emission is common and possibly strong enough to account for a significant fraction of the FeXXV disk emission from the Galaxy.
         612        1163 HR 1442 is a pair of B9 IV stars associated with the Taurus star formation region. It is also one of the brightest X-ray sources in this star formation region. ROSAT HRI observations could not resolve the pair. Ground based observations shows that one of the B stars has an infrared excess, a lithium absorption line, and may have a circumstellar disk. There is also a fainter IR-bright star nearby. We propose an HRC-I imaging observation to resolve the source(s) of the X-rays in this system. This will assist in elucidating the nature of the peculiar B star.
         613        1424 Our proposed 100ks LETG+ACIS-S observation of the X-ray bright active star sigma Gem will yield a wealth of X-ray plasma line diagnostics that will give us a giant leap forward in our understanding of its coronal densities, abundance anomalies and emission measure distribution. Unfortunately, there is one very basic unanswered question in the physics of active stellar coronae that the usual plasma diagnostics cannot address directly: What are the spatial characteristics of stellar coronae---the scale height and filling factor? What do other stellar coronae actually look like? We will provide the first direct spectroscopic answers to this question through two novel diagnostics of coronal geometry: photospheric fluorescence and resonance line optical depths.
         614        1428 FK Com is a single G-type giant rotating near the breakup velocity which is considered to be a recently coalesced binary. While generally displaying extreme levels of activity, FK Com is highly variable and surprisingly underluminous at X-ray wavelengths. This observed deficiency may be due either to obscuring material around the star, or to a dynamo mechanism which differs from that operating in other cool stars. We propose to observe FK Com and two similar stars, HD 199178 and LW Hya, to address this issue and others, such as the contribution of flaring to the observed X-ray luminosity and the question of whether or not the corona is corotating. In the case of LW Hya, we propose to use ACIS-I for a quick first look, while we will use HETG for an in-depth study of FK Com and HD 199178.
         615        1490 We propose to obtain AXAF ACIS-S-BI images of a sample of low mass stars and brown dwarfs. Until now, the lowest-mass dwarf detected in X-rays had been VB 8. Given the improved sensitivity of AXAF over previous missions, we are confident that coronal X-ray emission can now be detected in the very lowest mass stars and substellar objects known. Therefore, the objective of this proposal is to make such detections and thereby establish the existence of magnetic activity at the very bottom of the main sequence and beyond. Our target list includes the brown dwarfs Kelu-1 and BRI 0021-0214 along with the very low mass stars LHS 2924 and VB 10. We also request a short ACIS-S-BI image of the known X-ray source VB 8 as a prelude to future AXAF LETG observations.

         617        1734 The rho Ophiuchi cloud is one of the richest and nearest star forming regions with hundreds of young stellar objects (YSOs) representing all stages of early stellar evolution. It is a superb laboratory for the study of X-ray emission from YSOs with extensive multiwavelength data. AXAF observations will lead to insights concerning the dispersal of circumstellar disks, the impact of ionizing radiation and particles on disks, and the evolution of X-ray emission. We propose a mosaic of ACIS fields covering one square degree, designed to give a uniform sensitivity despite large changes in cloud extinction.

         624        1751 Almost all stars are X-ray emitters. Convective stars are thought to have analogs of the solar corona, caused by magnetic activity which in turn is produced by a dynamo. There are reasons to believe that the dynamo and coronal heating could change character near the bottom of the main sequence. We get to the heart of this by going to the very bottom of the main sequence, and below to the brown dwarf regime. We test 2 of the nearest known such objects to see if they lie beyond the end of the realm of stellar coronae.
         625        1782 We propose an observation of the bright hot white dwarf GD 246 with the Low Energy Transmission Grating. Our goal is to make use of the high spectral resolution offered by the LETG to unambiguously identify the chemical elements responsible for the short wavelength opacity in GD 246.
         626        1860 Although X-rays have been detected from essentially all types of stars, one portion of the X-ray H-R Diagram remains an enigma. Despite large surveys using Einstein and ROSAT, it is still not clear whether or not main sequence stars of intermediate mass (spectral types B3--A7) are intrinsic X-ray sources. Stars cooler than spectral type F0 are coronal X-ray sources and O3--B3 stars are wind X-ray sources, but are the intermediate mass stars intrinsic X-ray sources and how are they heated? We will exploit AXAF's three unique properties (high resolution imaging, high energy resolution, and high sensitivity detectors with very low background) to determine whether or not the intermediate mass stars are intrinsic X-ray sources and to study the nature of the X-ray emitting plasma.

         629        1879 The powerful winds of Wolf-Rayet (WR) stars generate strong X-rays via shock processes and also serve as an important source of chemical enrichment of the interstellar medium. We propose to obtain a high resolution X-ray spectrum of the colliding wind shock binary system Gamma Velorum (WC8 + O8), containing the closest WR star known. The spectrum will be rich in emission lines, providing information on mass loss parameters and shock geometry as well as metal abundances that can be used to test evolutionary models of massive stars.
         630        1921 Planetary nebulae (PNe) are expected to contain two types of X-ray sources: a hot central star with temperature between 100,000 and 200,000 K, and a shocked fast stellar wind at temperatures between 10$^6$ and 10$^8$ K. The shocked fast wind, if detected, allows us to peer into the PN interior and determine its physical conditions directly. We request ACIS-S observations of NGC 6543 (Cat's Eye Nebula) and NGC 7293 (Helix Nebula) in order to search for and analyze their shocked fast winds. NGC 6543 is the only PN for which diffuse X-ray emission has been previously reported and can be detected by the AXAF. NGC 7293 is the nearest PN, and hence provides the most promising case for which the hard and soft X-ray components may be spatially resolved and distinguished.

         632        2121 Eta Car may be the most massive and luminous star in the Galaxy (Davidson and Humphreys 1997). It has remained a mystery shrouded behind a thick massive cloud of ejecta. X-ray emission is both a probe through this curtain and a probe of this curtain. AXAF grating spectroscopy will help us make the next leap forward by addressing currently unresolved questions about the velocity field near the star, the stellar abundances and possible abundance gradients in the circumstellar ejecta, the processes of line excitation, and the nature of the hard X-ray emission and the nature of the star (or stars).
         633        2140 We propose to use ACIS-I to image the centers of the starburst analogues NGC 3603 in the Galaxy and NGC 346 in the SMC. This study will enable us to definitively determine the effects of abundance on X-ray emission, will provide X-ray luminosities for nearly 100 stars, will provide X-ray spectra for dozens of massive stars, and will enable us to examine the nature of diffuse emission and SNR on the local ISM.
         634        2169 We propose to observe the Orion Molecular Clouds, OMC 2 and OMC 3, with the ACIS-I instrument. With ASCA, these regions are found to exhibit hard X-ray emissions, possiblly from embedded Class 0 and Class I protostars. Our goal is to investigate; (1) when a star begins to emit X-rays, (2) what is the difference in X-rays (spectrum and time variability) between Class 0 and Class I, and the other phases of star formation (ClassII, III), and (3) what is the X-ray emission mechanism in the protostar phase.
         635        2170 With the ASCA observations of the Rho Oph dark cloud, we found variable hard X-ray emission from Class I sources. A Class I (EL29) shows a flare like TTSs, other (WL6) varies sinusoidally, suggesting rotation period, and the other (YLW15) exhibit quasi-periodic flares, suggestive for the star-disk magnetic connection. Non X-ray emitting Class I is also found. Our proposal is, with no source confusion problem, to confirm these variety of X-ray activity, to search for X-rays from other Class Is, as well as new X-ray emitting young stellar objects, using ACIS with the high spatial resolution up to 10 keV energy. Together with the radio search of bipolar structure, and comparison of TTSs, our goal is to give strong constrain on the evolution and structure of protostars.
         636        2221 Canopus (F0 Ib), the nearest (96 pc) supergiant, is a He-burning, post-red supergiant star that recently redeveloped a 20 million K corona and powers this corona at log Lx = 29.8 erg/s despite having a very thin convection zone. The coronae of Canopus and similar stars are remarkably constant, suggesting that while, the magnetic loops are efficiently heated, there is little interaction between the loops. Canopus is the brightest late-type supergiant in X-rays. We propose a 100 ksec HETG observation to measure the detailed coronal temperature and EM distributions for this unusual type of corona. Coronal abundances and densities will be estimated. In conjunction with HST/STIS spectra, we will investigate the coronal energy balance and heating mechanisms, and magnetic loop properties.
         637        2332 Einstein, ROSAT and ASCA observations of the rho Ophiuchus star-forming region have revealed X-ray flares, very hot plasma, and quasi-periodic variability from embedded young stellar objects, suggesting that some of the X-rays are produced by interactions between an accretion disk and large-scale magnetic fields. We propose to obtain a 100-ks ACIS-I exposure of rho Oph A in order to model X-ray spectra and light curves of YSOs spanning a wide range of masses and accretion rates. These include the magnetic B3 star S1, 2 Herbig Ae/Be stars, 2 class I protostars, 8 classical T Tauri stars, 3 weak-lined T Tauri stars, along with 40-50 new X-ray sources. AXAF's spatial resolution and effective area will allow us to model X-ray spectra of embedded sources not attainable with ROSAT or ASCA.
         638        2665 We propose to use the high spectral resolution of both the LETG and HETG to address several outstanding questions regarding X-ray production in B stars, including: Are coronal and wind mechanisms operating together in some B stars? Does the chaotic wind of tau Sco produce significant non-thermal emission ? What is the ionization balance in the stellar winds and how are X-rays reprocessed in the ambient wind? These questions can be addressed directly thanks to the ability afforded by AXAF to apply spectral diagnostic techniques used in the laboratory to X-ray astrophysics. These diagnostics include (1) line profile analysis, (2) density-sensitive line ratios, (3) continuum analysis, (4) temperature-sensitive line ratios, and (5) inner-shell emission and absorption.
         639        2733 In the case of the fast O-star winds, the spectrometers on AXAF will provide for the first time the spectral resolution needed to derive velocities of the X-ray emitting material, significant constraints on the location of the emitting regions, and accurate characterizations of the temperature and density conditions of the X-ray sources. The wind absorption occurs not only by bound-free transistions, but by bound-bound inner shell transistions. Thus, diagnostic modelling of the AXAF spectra will provide new information not only about the state of the hot emitting plasma, but also about of the cool wind. We propose AXAF transmission grating observations of 3 bright O-stars: Iota Ori (LETG), Zeta Pup (METG/HETG), and Delta Ori (LETG).

         641        2982 AXAF provides the first opportunity to study the dynamics of flaring plasma using the powerful tools of X-ray spectroscopy. We request AXAF observations of the nearest flare star, Proxima Centauri (M6 Ve), as part of a UNIQUE OPPORTUNITY for simultaneous X-ray and UV flare spectroscopy. We have 8 orbits (about 46 ks) of HST Cycle 8 GTO time (June 1999-May 2000) for high resolution UV spectra of Prox Cen in the continuous viewing zone. Simultaneous AXAF grating spectra will permit us to study the plasma motions and EM(T) with high time resolution to characterize the flare energetics at all layers in the atmosphere and to determine whether the 2-ribbon flare model as appropriate.
         642        3010 The Perseus cloud (d = 320 pc) is the nearest giant molecular cloud and harbors two rich clusters of pre-main sequence stars: NGC 1333 and IC 348. The proposed ACIS exposures will provide the deepest study of young stellar X-ray emission ever achieved and should detect about 400 sources. This study will improve the census of young stars in the clusters; probe the relationship between X-rays, disks and outflows; and investigate X-ray properties as a function of stellar luminosity, mass and especially age. The findings should give insight into possible effects of magnetic activity on protostars and T Tauri stars, such as X-ray and particle irradiation of the disk.
         643         705 The supersoft X-ray source RXJ0439.8-6809 is either the hottest known pre-white dwarf or an accreting double-degenerate white-dwarf binary. In the first case, RXJ0439.8-6809 puts strong constraints on the evolution of post-AGB stars; in the second case, it may have the shortest orbital period among all known accreting binaries. We propose to obtain a 40 ksec HRC-S+LETG observation, which will accurately determine the nature of the X-ray spectrum and the corresponding physical parameters, provide an accurate Rayleigh-Jeans extrapolation necessary to interprete the scheduled HST observations, possibly prove the white-dwarf nature of the X-ray source by detecting NeVIII absorption edges, and at best detect the predicted orbital period of a few minutes.
         644         796 This proposal is a continuation of a series of studies of the Supersoft Source RXJ0925.7-4758. Earlier studies involve spectra obtained by ROSAT, ASCA and Beppo-SAX. Many questions regarding the nature of RXJ0925.7-4758 have arisen that could not be answered using the available observations. This is due to the limited spectral resolution of ASCA SIS and Beppo-SAX LECS. We believe that the high spectral resolution of AXAF MEG/ACIS-S will definitively establish the true nature of RXJ0925.7-4758. Fitting grids of detailed model spectra, available to the investigators, will tightly constrain parameters like temperature, gravity and abundances. Thus we will be able to decide between a white dwarf, neutron star or black hole as a model for RXJ0925.7-4758.
         645         973 We propose to obtain a 24 ksec HRS-C LETG observation of AM Her, the prototype system of the magnetic cataclysmic variables. High resolution spectroscopy in the 0.1-6 keV energy range will allow us to quantitatively compare the soft X-ray spectrum with detailed accretion-heated model atmospheres. Absorption and emission edges of C, N, O, and Ne will provide diagnostic information on the ionization and temperature structure of the accretion region and on the structure, density, and homogenity of the accretion flow and its temporal fluctuations. There is good evidence from observations and theory that with the AXAF LETG we will for the first time be able to resolve the long-sought signatures of the temperature inversion in the heated atmosphere which are not visible in the EUV.
         646        1427 We propose an AXAF HETGS observation of the brightest dwarf nova SS Cygni in its normal quiescent state. The unprecedented spectral resolution afforded by AXAF will make this the first observation of a hard-X-ray cataclysmic-variable boundary layer in which it is possible fully to resolve individual lines (other than Fe-K). The spectrum will allow us to measure the temperature distribution of the shock-heated plasma and constrain its density and elemental abundances. Measurement of these quantities will form the observational basis on which to build a theoretical understanding of the complex shocks which form in the strongly-shearing flow of the boundary layer.
         647        1608 We will use the HETG to observe the 0.4-10 keV spectrum of the simplest, most straightforward, bright disk system at quiescence (the prototypical dwarf nova U Gem) in order to obtain good diagnostics for the boundary layer plasma as it undergoes transition from an 8 keV low density region to the atmosphere of a 30,000K white dwarf. The use of the Fe lines at 6.4-6.7 keV together with the emission lines in the 0.5-2 keV region will provide information on the correct temperature and density structure, the photoionization/collisional processes and the abundances of the material transferred from the secondary star. In addition, the velocity broadening in the lines will give insight into the rotation and location of the gas.
         648        1766 We propose to observe the dwarf nova SS Cygni in outburst with the AXAF LETGS and HETGS to (1) measure the differential emission measure of the X-ray emitting plasma over three decades in temperature (from ~ 3e5 to 3e8 K), (2) measure the abundances and density of the plasma responsible for the hard component of the spectrum, (3) determine or constrain the physical conditions and emission mechanism(s) responsible for the soft component of the spectrum, and (4) measure the spectrum of the soft X-ray oscillations, thereby diagnosing their cause. Finally, assisted by simultaneous RXTE observations, we will measure the line and continuum spectrum reflected from the surface of the white dwarf and accretion disk.
         649        1943 Intermediate Polars (IPs) are the hard X-ray brightest subclass of magnetic Cataclysmic Variables. Previous X-ray observations, notably those with ASCA, have established the complex nature of their spectra: multi-temperature plasma and complex absorber are both required. Moreover, one recent study suggests that the Fe lines are Compton broadened in at least some systems. We propose HETG observations of 2 bright IPs, V1223 Sgr and AO Psc, to search for K-alpha lines of Ne, Mg, Si, S, Ar and Ca; to measure the physical widths of any lines we do detect; to search for a direct evidence for an ionized absorber; and to obtain an improved characterization of the spin modulation.
         650        2086 We propose an AXAF ACIS-I observation to study the detailed morphology and the spectrum of the nova shell of GK Persei 1901 SIMULTANEOUSLY in X-ray wavelengths. The shell was recently detected with the ROSAT HRI, thus no spectral information was derived from the data. We plan to exploit the spatial and spectral capabilities of the ACIS-I detector in order to study the spectrum of the source in comparison to other wavelengths. We expect that such an observation will have great implications on our understanding of the classical novae evolution , outburst mechanisms together with the interaction of the nova shells with their environments of interstellar or circumstellar origin and physics of strong shock formation.
         651        2462 The nearby (~200pc) R Aqr symbiotic system, a known EXOSAT/ROSAT source, is a well-known prototype for non-relativistic astrophysical jets, giving a unique AXAF opportunity to resolve spatially an x-ray system with mass infall onto a compact hot object with an accretion disk and jet. The R Aqr jet has been extensively observed in the UV, optical, and radio by Hollis et al. Previous ROSAT HRI observations could not resolve the jet, but, based on HST UV and VLA radio data, shock model temperatures indicate that an x-ray jet is about the same size as the UV jet. This AXAF observation will yield ~4000 counts, enough for a high quality image. Using the ACIS BI spectrum, optically thin hot gas lines will be evident; time variations and source modeling will also be pursued.
         652        2657 We propose to obtain spectrophotometry with the ACIS-FI instrument, plus contemporaneous ground based optical and infrared spectra, of bright novae in outburst. Previous studies with X-ray satellites have shown that they are the best tool for studying the hot phases of the nova outburst. In these observations, both soft and hard emission components were found. Observations of the soft component will provide a unique opportunity to study the composition of the ejecta, the lifetime of the outburst, and the evolution of the white dwarf. The hard component is, as yet, unexplained and further observations are urgently needed to understand its cause and behavior which will improve our understanding of the evolution of the ejecta. We will obtain observations of both components when possible.
         653        2726 We propose to obtain a 70 ksec ACIS observation of the globular cluster Omega Cen. A high rate of stellar interactions and large core make Omega Cen a prime target for the study of low-luminosity cluster X-ray sources. We will (1) measure the luminosity function and radial distribution of cataclysmic variables down to Lx = 2e30 erg/s; (2) determine the frequency of RS CVn X-ray binaries in a globular cluster for the first time; (3) provide the accurate positions needed for identifying optical counterparts in crowded fields; and (4) enable detailed comparisons between clusters with different dynamical properties. An order of magnitude more sensitive than previous work, this study will provide new constraints on primordial and capture binaries that are vital to cluster dynamical evolution.
         654        3008 The extreme stellar density and yet relatively large core of the massive globular cluster Terzan 5 make it the ideal target for the study of the formation of compact objects and binaries in dense stellar systems. We propose a deep ACIS-I exposure to study both its known LMXB and bright (eclipsing) MSP and to measure its underlying distribution of LMXBs, CVs and MSPs. When combined with our upcoming HST/NICMOS survey of Ter5 for emission line object identifications, this AXAF observation will set significant constraints on the origin of cluster binaries and neutron stars, the evolutionary links between LMXBs and MSPs, and the cluster gravitational potential.

         656         802 In a recent 100 ks ROSAT HRI observation of the binary ms-pulsar PSR J0218+4232 we detected a lightcurve with two narrow pulses; the measured width of the main pulse (350 microsec) is compatible with the scatter in the ROSAT clock. About 60% of the emission is unpulsed and can be explained by emission from a compact nebula with diameter ~14'', compatible with available radio data. Only AXAF's HRC-I can disentangle the spatial emission, as well as resolve the narrow structures in the lightcurve; a 75 ks observation suffices. We further propose a spectral study of this ms-pulsar and its probable synchrotron nebula with AXAF's ACIS-I detector (100 ks) in order to investigate the underlying production processes.
         657        1055 We will observe the supergiant X-ray binary 4U 1700-37 for 40-50% of its orbit, from its normal bright state through the pre-eclipse absorption state, and into eclipse. We will map the accreting wind from the variable absorption column and absorption edges. We expect to see a rich line spectrum including fluorescent and recombination lines. We will investigate the response of these lines and the absorption to X-ray flares. By mapping the gas jet from the companion and the stellar wind, we can determine the accretion rate from the both the spherical wind and from Roche lobe overflow.
         658        1278 We propose to use ACIS-I to image the fields of the eight X-ray binaries with strong evidence for relativistic jets. In this way we will investigate the energetics of such outflows by observing the energy they deposit in the ISM through interactions with the ambient medium. This will provide an estimate of the power of such outflows from neutron stars and black holes which is independent of the assumptions associated with estimates based on light curves and radio observations, as well as shedding light on their local environments. All the fields will be quasi-simultaneously mapped at a comparable resolution at radio wavelengths to examine the relation between synchrotron-emitting electrons and high energy emission.

         660        1368 Previous ASCA observations of the X-ray transient GRS1915+105 have revealed prominent absorption lines from highly ionized iron, possibly due to a photoionized wind from the putative black hole accretion disk. We propose to perform high resolution spectroscopy of the iron line complex via a 30ksec ACIS-S/HETG observation. The line of sight velocity and velocity dispersion of the absorbing matter will be accurately measured, and the P-Cygni profiles (confirming the presence of a wind) will be sought. By aligning the ACIS-S with the axis of the known jet, we will be sensitive to any multiple-arcminute scale structure in this jet. We also aim to propose for RXTE observations which will compliment this study by constraining the geometry/structure of the disk/corona system.
         661        1404 There exists a group of persistently faint galactic X-ray sources that, based on characteristics such as location in the galaxy, high Lx/Lopt, association with X-ray bursts, absence of X-ray pulsations and similar characteristics are thought to be low-mass X-ray binaries but about which very little is known. These objects have low Lx and most have not been optically identified. We propose to observe a sample of these sources with ACIS in modes and with exposure times tailored to obtain an arcsecond position, and to measure a good X-ray spectrum and a good power spectrum. This will extend our knowledge about the physics of accretion onto compact objects towards lower accretion rates than previously accessible.

         671        1543 We propose to observe 4U 1822-37 with the ACIS-S-HETG. 4U 1822-37 is the only observable accretion disk corona source in the original class of these objects. Past observations have only detected a few low equivalent width lines rather than the dense line emission expected from models of ADCs. Attempts to fit these data have been unsuccessful leaving unanswered many questions regarding the nature of the compact and companion stars and the mechanism of mass transfer and coronal formation. With the high resolution of the HETG gratings we will be able to finally resolve any existing line structure and use these diagnostics to constrain models of this peculiar form of LMXB.
         672        1658 The highly luminous bursting X-ray sources in the cores of globular clusters are some of the most exotic stellar systems known. Recently HST imaging has led to optical candidates for many of these central cluster sources, but these candidates have a diverse range of properties. Even for the most accurate (3") X-ray positions extant pre-AXAF, there are sometimes hundreds of candidate counterparts permitted on positional grounds alone; evidence is thus quite inconclusive, and some of the current candidates may be incorrect. We propose to obtain highly accurate AXAF positions for most of the known sources, reducing the number of candidates by up to 100X, using an instrument configuration that will also provide a homogeneous set of high resolution spectra for much of the sample.

         675        1867 X2127+119 exhibits dips with a period of 17.1 hours. Its accretion disk may possess an ionized corona (ADC), though the apparent lack of reprocessing of a bright type I burst disputes this possibility. One diagnostic of ADC conditions is strong discrete emission, whose analysis sheds light upon the location of and temperature and ionization level in the reprocessing gas. To date this system has never been observed spectroscopically with good energy resolution or at soft X-ray energies (where spectral features abound). We propose two observations of X2127+119: one using the ACIS-S-LETG and one using the ACIS-S-HETG. We show that X2127+119 is sufficiently bright to produce good spectra and that such spectra will likely include numerous strong soft emission features.
         676        1901 We propose to establish the existence of black-hole event horizons by comparing accreting black holes to accreting neutron stars. Such a comparison is feasible because black holes and neutron stars are both present in similar environments in X-ray novae. Recently, a very successful model (ADAF model) has been applied to X-ray novae. It predicts that variations in luminosity between the quiescent state and the outburst state for X-ray novae that contain black holes are expected to be > 100 times larger than for X-ray novae that contain neutron stars. Preliminary results from ROSAT and ASCA support this prediction, as expected if black holes have event horizons and neutron stars do not. The proposed observations with AXAF can firmly establish whether black holes have event horizons.

         678        2056 The Rapid Burster (RB) is a recurrent transient low-mass X-ray binary with type II burst phenomenology that makes it unique in the Galaxy. We propose to obtain high-resolution grating spectra (ACIS-S + HETG) of the RB in outburst. In one 30 ksec observation we will collect ~150,000 photons from type II bursts and at least ~90,000 photons from the persistent emission. Spectral features in the type II bursts and the persistent emission may illuminate the physics of the accretion process that drives these bursts, perhaps allowing us to finally understand some of the physics behind this enigmatic object.
         679        2162 We propose to study the X-ray spectra of black-hole (candidate) X-ray binaries (BHXBs) in outburst. We will follow the outburst throughout its evolution across all wavelength bands, and will select certain periods for X-ray spectral analysis with AXAF. High-resolution X-ray spectra of the BHXBs will likely exhibit emission lines and absorption edges characteristic of the accretion disk geometry, temperatures, and abundances. We expect that they will show the general-relativistic effects of the extreme gravitational environment near the black hole. When possible, we will make (near) simultaneous radio, IR, optical, X-ray timing (RXTE), and gamma-ray (CGRO-BATSE) observations. Our team has extensive expertise in all aspects of the proposed research.

We will follow the outburst throughout its evolution across all wavelength bands, and will select certain periods for X-ray spectral analysis with AXAF. High-resolution X-ray spectra of the BHXBs will likely exhibit emission lines and absorption edges characteristic of the accretion disk geometry, temperatures, and abundances. We expect that they will show the general-relativistic effects of the extreme gravitational environment near the black hole. When possible, we will make (near) simultaneous radio, IR, optical, X-ray timing (RXTE), and gamma-ray (CGRO-BATSE) observations.

         700        2210 Serpens X-1 and 4U 1735-44 are two bursting low-mass X-ray binaries which have shown confirmed Fe K line emission and less certain evidence of low energy line emission. Reported variations in Fe K line, energy, and width suggest that the inner disk region is sometimes the dominant formation region for these relatively luminous persistent sources at low inclination. Quasiperiodic oscillations at high frequencies also arise in the inner disk region and simultaneous RXTE data would correlate temporal behavior, the continuum and lines. For each source we propose an 80 ksec HETG/ACIS observation likely to include at least a few bursts. Simultaneous HETG and RXTE burst spectra would test predicted divergence from black body models and better constrain neutron star parameters.
         701        2251 ASCA observations of the LMXRB X0918-54,X1543-62 and X0614+09 reveal strong emission lines in the 0.5-1 keV band.The emission is consistent with Oxygen and Iron L,but major uncertanties remain in establishing the line emission mechanism.The recombination continuum,a signature of photoinonization,is missing or at lower level in all systems. A collisionial plasma better reproduces the spectrum. Scattering and 3-body recombinations are other possible mechanism that can lower the recombination. Observations with the AXAF HETG of the 3 objects can differentiate line emission with an unprecedented resolving power.This capability will pin-down the underline mechanism responsible for the line emission, and define abundances to constrain the system evolution.

         703        2347 We propose to undertake a survey of Galactic X-ray binaries with the ACIS-S+HETG. Owing to their proximity and brightness, X-ray binaries provide otherwise unobtainable insight into the accretion process. We will: investigate the physical conditions of the emitting gas using emission and recombination line diagnostics to determine temperatures, densities, elemental abundances, and ionization structure; test and improve models of X-ray line emission developed by us over the past decade; and generate an atlas of spectra for use in comparative studies of X-ray binaries. Insights gained from this work will be applicable to irradiated, accreting plasmas which are present in regions of star formation, interacting main-sequence binaries, active galactic nuclei and quasars.

         705        2656 The HMXB Cen X-3 is an eclipsing X-ray pulsar with an O-star companion. It is the brightest X-ray source in its class. Spectroscopically, the phase-averaged spectrum is a complex superposition of a bright continuum, disk-reprocessed emission, and lines from a photoionized wind. The presence of an accretion disk renders Cen X-3 overluminous relative to Bondi-Hoyle wind accretion, resulting in a very high level of ionization in the wind. We propose to observe Cen X-3 during eclipse with the HETG, which will allow us to spectrally isolate the wind, focusing on its ionization, emission measure distribution, and velocity structure. To accomplish this, we have developed an X-ray spectral model that has been successfully applied to ASCA spectra of other wind-dominated sources.
         706        2664 We propose to make the first grating-resolution X-ray spectra of Cir X-1 during one of its zero phase passages. Our ASCA analyses of Cir X-1 have shown that its variable iron K features can be explained using a direct flux plus scattered flux model, and HETG spectra will test our model. During zero phase `dips' we expect line emission from an accretion disk corona (ADC), since we predict predominantly ADC scattered emission below 5 keV. Line measurements will constrain the ADC ionization parameter, temperature, thickness and motion. We will also make the highest resolution iron K line/edge measurements and use them to study obscuring matter. Our observation will not cause telemetry saturation, and our dispersed spectra will not have serious photon pile up.
         707        2673 We propose a 40 ksec AXAF HETG TOO observation of the microquasar GRO J1655-40 during outburst. The object shows both radio-loud and radio-quiet X-ray outbursts, with relativistic jets accompanying the radio outbursts. Clear evidence for intense emission near 1 keV and complex absorption in the Fe K band, rare for a black hole candidate, have been observed with ASCA. The HETG can be used to great advantage here, allowing us to extract detailed line diagnostics and, through precise measurements of Doppler shifts, identify the possible relationship of the line component to the jets. GRO J1655-40 represents a unique opportunity to explore (``up close'') transient outburst accretion physics in a black hole.
         708        2678 We propose TOO monitoring observations with ACIS-S-BI of Aql X-1, the Rapid Burster, and one other type-I bursting transient in quiescence following an outburst. Heat deposited in the deep neutron star (NS) crust during outburst diffuses out on a timescale (about a year) which scales as the fourth power of the NS radius. Temporal evolution will thus provide an observational handle on the NS radius. Our data will be analyzed using realistic emergent spectra, thus obtaining a second, independent radius constraint. We also request one LETG+HRC-S observation directly after an outburst for Aql X-1 and the "other" object (if it has a low Av) to search for the 549 Hz pulse period (in Aql X-1) and the possible presence of metals in the thermal NS atmosphere.

         713        2690 Transient type-I X-ray bursters have been previously detected during ``quiescence'', at fluxes much lower than when in outburst. We propose ACIS-S-BI spectroscopy of six such transients in quiescence, to discover whether their luminosity is due to the delayed escape of energy deposited in the crust during the outburst or to low-level advection-dominated accretion. If accretion is active, we will observe X-ray spectra with a detectable red-shifted oxygen photo-ionization edge. If accretion is not active, then the faint emission is due only to a hot crust, and we expect spectra which are consistent with a pure hydrogen atmosphere, and no rapid variability. In both cases, we will measure the neutron star surface area (normalized by distance) by utilizing realistic emergent spectra.
         714        2864 We propose to use the unprecedented X-ray spatial resolution and aspect determination accuracy of AXAF to obtain the optical/IR identification of what may be the most intense but as yet unidentified steady X-ray source on the celestial sphere, GX17+2 (=X1813-140). Although this object is a prototype of the important Z-sources (which include Sco X-1 and Cyg X-2), evidence is now very strong that the long-accepted optical identification is incorrect. We have recently obtained HST NICMOS observations of the field which point the way towards reopening this perplexing problem of 25 years duration. The proposed observations will simultaneously provide a high-quality X-ray spectrum.
         715        2870 We propose to observe 7 bright GX sources with the AXAF HETG to (1) study narrow emission and absorption line features in their spectra which will help disentangle the different physical processes involved, (2) determine the source positions to better than 1" accuracy which will greatly improve the chances of identifying the optical counterparts with future HST observations, and (3) measure the energy-dependent halo structures surrounding these sources to probe the composition and size distribution of the intervening interstellar grains.

         718        2949 We propose a short HRC-I observation to obtain a precise location for the unusual Galactic black hole candidate and so-called microquasar, GRS~1758-258. A precise location will either confirm or reject the association of this X-ray source with the core of a double lobed radio jet structure. It will also enable deep infrared follow-up observations to search for stellar companions, and hopefully identify the system as a low or high mass X-ray binary. Since the source is near the Galactic center, more than a dozen K-band objects appear in the current best (ROSAT) error circle making identification difficult.
         719        3002 We propose to survey the 7 remaining bright LMXBs (using HRC) and 1 quiescent NS-LMXB transient (using ACIS-I) in globular clusters for which accurate positions are not available. These will enable optical IDs with HST which then constrain the LMXB mass and evolution. Faint sources can be resolved with the HRC down to limits which will constrain the bright LMXB luminosity function. The deeper ACIS observation will measure the dim source content and qLMXB spectrum. The full 12 cluster LMXB data set can then constrain LMXB masses, the cluster potential, and dark remnant content of globular cluster cores.

         723         767 The 'anomalous' X-ray pulsars are a small group of very young X-ray pulsars whose properties (period distribution, X-ray spectra, associations with supernova remnants, no evidence for binarity) are strikingly different from those of normal binary X-ray pulsars. Their similarities to soft gamma repeaters supports the idea that they are strongly magnetized (10^14 G) solitary neutron stars ('magnetars'). We propose to make AXAF observations to search for small plerions around them, and to establish the presence of blackbody-like emission from the neutron star surface, both of which would provide strong evidence for the magnetar model.

         725         765 The 'anomalous' X-ray pulsars are a small group of very young X-ray pulsars whose properties (period distribution, X-ray spectra, associations with supernova remnants, no evidence for binarity) are strikingly different from those of normal binary X-ray pulsars. Their similarities to soft gamma repeaters supports the idea that they are strongly magnetized (10^14 G) solitary neutron stars ('magnetars'). We propose to make AXAF observations to search for small plerions around them, and to establish the presence of blackbody-like emission from the neutron star surface, both of which would provide strong evidence for the magnetar model.

         727         780 We propose to observe the shrapnel A of the Vela SNR using the AXAF ACIS. This is believed to be a raw ejecta produced during the SN explosion. There are several shrapnels reported. Some of them are observed with ASCA SIS showing that they show abnormal metal abundance. We selected the shrapnel A, showing Si rich abundance, since it has enough surface brightness and is rather compact. We can reveal the compression of matter in its top region while the peel off of matter in its bottom region. The top region will have some stratification of matter: the interstellar matter, the circumstellar matter and the Si rich ejecta. The bottom region will show the Si streak. These can be obtained solely by using high spatial resolution of AXAF as well as the spectral resolution of ACIS.
         728         953 As the youngest member of the pure-plerion class of SNRs, yet with X-ray and radio properties strikingly different from the Crab Nebula, 3C 58 is one of the most important remnants in the Galaxy. Studies to date have clearly revealed a central compact source whose spectrum is compatible with hot polar cap emission from a neutron star. Broadband studies of 3C 58 show a spectral break below the IR indicative of a rapid decline in the pulsar output at a recent epoch. Prior X-ray measurements have been incapable of cleanly separating the pulsar and nebular spectra. Here we propose an ACIS observation which will provide us with the first opportunity to accurately measure the X-ray properties of the central pulsar and to investigate the detailed properties of its associated nebula.
         729        1041 G11.2-0.3 and Kes 73 are two composite SNRs whose properties are virtually indistinguishable but for one glaring exception. While the thermal properties of each indicate a young SNR which resulted from a typical explosion in a somewhat dense medium, the compact central relics produced during the supernova events are dramatically different. In G11.2-0.3 we find a 65 ms pulsar driving an extended synchrotron nebula, typical of scenarios for young SNRs from massive star progenitors. In Kes 73, however, there resides an unresolved source whose rotation rate is nearly 200 times slower than its would-be cousin in G11.2-0.3. We propose ACIS imaging, spectral, and timing studies of each remnant to help us understand the divergent evolutionary paths which have led to these contrasting objects.

         731        1226 In the ROSAT Bright Survey (RBS) We have almost completely optically identified the brightest 2000 high galactic latitude sources from the ROSAT All-Sky-Survey Bright Source Catalogue (1RXS). A small number of sources has empty X-ray error boxes on the POSS plates. HRI follow-up observations of RBS 1223, a very soft object with extreme X-ray to optical flux ratio, confirm a relatively bright X-ray source with a 1.5 arcsec empty error box on the POSS II plate and CCD images. Chances are high that this is a new isolated neutron star (INS). We propose a 10 ksec observation with the AXAF ACIS-S BI in order to i) obtain a high-quality X-ray spectrum of the source, ii) improve its X-ray position and iii) look for X-ray pulsations.
         732        1514 Recent X- and gamma-ray observations show that X-rays from the bright NE and SW limbs of SN1006 are due mainly to synchrotron radiation from electrons accelerated at the shock. This explains a very mysterious SNR, and provides the best evidence of cosmic ray acceleration in SN shocks. Meanwhile, X-rays from the NW limb of SN1006 appear dominated by thermal emission from an ionizing plasma. We propose deep ACIS-I observations of the NE and the NW limbs of SN1006 to better determine the shock conditions in SN1006 and to constrain the fundamental physics of shocks. SN1006 is unique in that the physics of shocks producing non-thermal (in the NE) and thermal (in the NW) X-rays can be tested in one object; furthermore, the spatial scales are well-matched to the angular resolution of AXAF.
         733        1556 The Cygnus Loop, as the closest, brightest, and best-studied example of its class, is the prototypical shell supernova remnant (SNR). SNR evolution is complex because the interstellar medium is inhomogeneous and modified by the supernova progenitor. We propose to study the interaction of the Cygnus Loop with its environment and hence elucidate its evolution. X-ray spectroscopy provides the best tools to quantify the conditions and the microscopic and macroscopic processes that determine the balance between heating and cooling in shocked gas. AXAF provides revolutionary capabilities because it offers the first opportunity to obtain imaging spectroscopy with the combined spatial and spectral resolution necessary to measure plasma properties on scales relevant to blast wave gas-dynamics.

         735        1561 We propose 50 ks ACIS-I observations of three extragalactic supernovae aged 1000-2000 days post-explosion in order to study the interaction of supernova ejecta with circumstellar matter. Each target presents unique observational opportunities: SN~1993J, whose unprecedented x-ray, radio, and optical evolution may reflect a complex binary interaction; SN~1995N, the only member of the class of peculiar Type~II events to be observed at x-ray energies at such an early evolutionary phase; and SN~1996cb, the only other SN 1993J-like Type~IIb available for x-ray study. Data will be used to probe the dynamics of the interaction region; examine the structure of the supernova ejecta and the circumstellar medium; and to study the late stages of stellar evolution.
         736        1564 Recent ASCA observations of G347.5-0.5 reveal bright regions of nonthermal emission along the rim where the SNR appears to be interacting with an adjacent cloud. This emission is reminiscent of that seen in SN 1006, where it appears that electrons have been accelerated to energies up to 100 TeV by the SNR blast wave. Even more surprisingly, emission from the interior regions appears to display a featureless nonthermal spectrum as well. Radio observations reveal emission around much of the shell, with structured emission along the regions of bright X-ray emission. We propose two AXAF observations of G347.5-0.5 in order to carry out a detailed study of the structure and spectrum of the bright shell region and to perform a sensitive search for thermal emission from the interior.

         738        1568 The remarkable supernova remnant SNR 0538-69.1 in the LMC contains the recently discovered 16 ms pulsar, the fastest known pulsar associated with a SNR. This Crab-like remnant consists of three distinct X-ray-emitting components: a compact source, an unusual elongated feature, and a diffuse emission region. We propose an HRC observation to pinpoint the location of the pulsar, to conduct detailed timing analysis, and to resolve the structure of the remnant, particularly the elongated X-ray feature. This observation, together with an off-axis ACIS-I pointing and our extensive multiwavelength database of the region, will allow for a comprehensive study of the structure and evolution of the remnant and will provide important constraints on pulsar evolution.
         739        1575 ACIS observations are proposed to disentangle the complex hard X-ray environment of the bright unidentified gamma-ray source 2EG J1811-2339. ASCA data have shown a diffuse nonthermal nebula consistent with a plerion and a complex of X-ray sources coincident with a nearby stellar association. AXAF angular resolution is needed to isolate a possible pulsar point source in the candidate plerion, to identify the individual hot stars seen in hard X-rays and to map the non-thermal emission at fine scales. A modest ACIS exposure accomplishes these tasks and provides important spectral constraints on the point source components. This project will shed light on the nature of this GeV source and may identify the birthsite of its stellar progenitor.
         740        1609 The Cygnus Loop has been imaged completely in X-rays by the ROSAT PSPC All-Sky Survey with low spectral resolution. ASCA spectral observations have yielded interesting results for specific areas of the Cygnus Loop, such as the northeast rim, which have been modeled by (dynamically) simple non-equilibrium ionization models. Here a bright region on the southwest rim has been identified using ROSAT PSPC data which shows the strongest spectral variation in the Cygnus Loop. The AXAF ACIS-I field of 16 by 16 arcmin is large enough to encompass this field, allowing spatially resolved spectroscopy which can yield an entirely new perspective on the state of the plasma and on the dynamics in the Cygnus Loop.
         741        1910 PSR J0437-4715 is the nearest millisecond pulsar, and the only one that can be studied comprehensively in X-rays. The leading interpretation of its ROSAT spectrum and energy-dependent pulse shape involves thermal emission from heated polar caps emitting as a weakly magnetized neutron star atmosphere. Fundamental parameters such as M/R can be derived if such an interpretation is correct. ACIS-I, with its good spectral resolution and high-energy response, can confirm this model and determine the chemical composition of the atmosphere. The HRC-I will also be used for precise timing relative to the radio pulse, and for high-resolution imaging of the pulsar, its bow shock, and its possible compact nebula.

         743        1966 We propose two ACIS observations of bullet D in the Vela supernova remnant, a bright feature which protrudes outside the main blast wave on the east side of the remnant. Using these observations, we can distinguish between the bullet picture, in which a fragment of supernova ejecta is now pushing beyond the blast wave, from a shock break-out picture, in which inhomogeneities in the ambient medium cause the shock to be non-spherical. Comparison of these AXAF/ACIS data with existing ultraviolet and optical data from the same region will provide strong constraints on the models.

         745        1970 RXJ 0720.4-3125 is a bright soft X-ray source with a period of 8 s. Our Keck observations reveal a faint blue optical counterpart. We argue that the X-ray source must be a nearby neutron star which is either accreting from the ISM or a cooling magnetar. These two models bear distinctive spectral signatures: in the first case the surface emission is modified by the accreted gas whereas in the second case the iron surface is severely affected by super strong magnetic field strengths. A single LETG/HRC observation will confirm the proposed optical counterpart and enable us to uncover the nature of the source. Regardless of the models, this object -- one of the nearest neutron stars with an anomalous period -- is bound to be fascinating.
         746        1973 We request a 40-ks ACIS-I exposure towards the soft gamma repeater SGR 1806-20. One of three known repeaters, SGR 1806-20, lies in the core of the amorphous radio nebula G 10.0-0.3. Its stochastic bursting action and variable radio activity have been hypothesised to be due to an ultramagnetized neutron star. So far, little is known about the SGR's quiescent X-ray counterpart discovered with ASCA due to lack of sensitive high-angular resolution observations. We argue that these observations will provide the critical insight (that radio work and past X-ray work could not) needed for better physical understanding of SGRs
         747        1974 The class of soft Gamma-ray Repeater (SGR) 0525-66 remain mysterious to date. One SGR, 1806-20, has been identified with a plerionic supernova remnant, with a persistent non-thermal X-ray source. SGR 0526-66 of the 5-March-1979 burst fame has been localized to the compact supernova remnant N49 in the LMC. Our sustained campaign with ASCA and ROSAT suggests that the quiescent X-ray counterpart has a soft X-ray spectrum. This can be inferred in the framework of the magnetar (highly magnetized neutron stars) model. AXAF medium resolution spectroscopy is the key to understanding the nature of this mysterious counterpart. Additionally, ACIS imaging will enable us to search for the expected synchrotron nebula powered by either the quiescent source (as in 1806-20) or by past bright bursts.
         748        2091 In our quest for an understanding of neutron star birth properties, we have but two examples of young neutron stars: the Crab and 0540-69 in the LMC. We seek to find a third in 3C58 (SN1181) in a companion proposal, and may hope to see a fourth emerge in SN1987A during AXAF's lifetime. Here, we propose to search for another in G29.7-0.3, a remnant on the other side of the Galaxy which exhibits an intense central synchrotron nebula surrounded by a bright, 2' shell of thermal emission. ASCA observations clearly establish the two emission components, but are completely incapable of spatially resolving them or allowing the search for a central point source. This object is an AXAF "poster remnant", an SNR like it otta be.
         749        2149 The radio-silent neutron stars in SNRs, 1E 1207.4-5209 in PKS 1209-52 and RX J0821-4300 in Puppis A, provide unique opportunity to study cooling of young neutron stars and the properties of the superdense matter in their interiors. The ROSAT and ASCA observations of these objects have been interpreted in terms of neutron star atmosphere models. We propose AXAF observations to determine chemical composition, magnetic field and temperature of the atmospheres, to constrain the neutron star radius and mass, to search for so far unknown rotation periods and for putative compact nebulae around the neutron stars. We will also investigate the chemical composition, density, temperature and ionization state of the diffuse matter in the supernova remanants.

         752        2212 PSR 1055-52 is the oldest of 3 middle-aged pulsars from which thermal radiation has been detected. Its radiation has two components, soft and hard, with different spectra and pulse profiles. The soft component is emitted from the entire neutron star surface, while the origin of the hard component (polar caps or magnetosphere) remains elusive. The spectroscopy and timing of PSR 1055-52 with ACIS-S, interpreted in terms of neutron star atmosphere models, will enable us to elucidate the nature of the hard component, to determine chemical composition and distributions of temperature and magnetic field at the neutron star surface, and to constrain star's mass and radius. A complementing HRC-I observation will yield a high-resolution image to search for a compact nebula around the pulsar.
         753        2318 The young energetic radio pulsar PSR B1757-24 is traveling at high velocity out of the supernova remnant G5.4-1.2, in the process, re-energizing the remnant's shell, and powering a synchrotron nebula having dramatic bow-shock morphology. AXAF observations will determine properties of the pulsar wind that are unobservable in other systems, and permit detailed study of the unusual pulsar/remnant interaction. Useful X-ray observations of the PSR B1757-24/G5.4-1.2 system have been impossible before AXAF, because of the low predicted count rates for ROSAT, and because of a nearby unrelated bright source that contaminated the ASCA field. The first X-ray observation of this unique source has thus awaited the arrival of AXAF, with its high energy response, and unparalleled spatial resolution.
         754        2326 PSR B1509-58 is the second youngest pulsar known in the Galaxy, after the Crab. It is located in the supernova remnant G320-1.2 (MSH 15-52). The system consists of multiple components: an expanding shell, an optical nebula, a pulsar-powered "plerion," and the pulsar itself. With the unparalleled spatial resolution and high-energy response of AXAF, the PSR B1509-58 system promises to be the next powerful laboratory for studying the physics of the pulsar wind and its interaction with its surroundings. In particular, the proposed observations will establish (i) whether there is a compact component to the plerion or a Crab-like torus morphology (ii) whether or not a claimed jet from the pulsar actually exists (iii) what powers the unusual optical nebula.
         755        2398 We propose ACIS exposures of high-velocity pulsars that produce cometary-shaped bowshock nebulae. Several targets are known bowshocks from previous Halpha or soft X-ray observations, while others are promising targets based on scaling laws for thermal and synchrotron emission from shocked interstellar gas and pulsar wind. The high-angular resolution and energy range of AXAF will allow us to (a) detect shocked gas and calculate, through morphology, constraints on the direction of motion and gas density; (b) place limits on the energy spectrum of pulsar-wind particles; (c) address the physics of electron heating, shock acceleration, and turbulence; and (d) evaluate the role of magnetic reconnection near the wind-shock interface.
         756        2433 The young "Vela"-like isolated neutron star PSR B1706-44 is a copious emitter of high energy radiation. The system is a composite one with the neutron star embedded in a 27 arcsec compact synchrotron nebula. We are proposing HRC-I and ACIS-I observations with the aim of: 1) detecting the pulsations from the young neutron star and phase relating the pulsed light curve to the gamma-ray light curve; 2) characterizing the morphology of the compact synchrotron nebula and ascertaining the energetics of the system; and 3) measuring the surface temperature of the neutron star and the spectrum of the compact nebula. These observations will help in the understanding of the spindown energy loss and the thermal evolution of neutron star matter.

         758        2442 We propose imaging the Crab Nebula and Pulsar to achieve 2 fundamental objectives uniquely obtainable with AXAF -- (1) high-resolution imaging of nebular features and (2) measuring (or constraining) the surface temperature of the underlying neutron star. Imaging the Crab requires use of a grating as a neutral density filter. Thus our observations will also provide high-resolution spectroscopy to allow studies of absorption in the interstellar medium, including Extended X-ray Absorption Fine Structure, and spectral variation within the Nebula.

         760        2470 AXAF is ideally suited to investigate the hard X-ray region of the SNR IC 443, which is currently thought to be X-ray synchrotron radiation as a result of a particular interaction between a shock and a molecular cloud. Alternate explanations, such as a pulsar powered nebula, have still not been completely ruled out. This proposed observation will image the currently unresolved core of hard emission, map out the hardness ratio to arcsecond resolution and enable "sliding box" style spectral fitting which can constrain the hard X-ray spectral index within +/-0.1 with arcminute spatial resolution. This observation is a key part of a multi-wavelength observing program to investigate the synchrotron structure of this anomalous region.
         761        2489 In many Type II supernovae (SNe), and some SN Ib/c, the interaction between the SN shock and the circumstellar material shed by the progenitor star creates a strong reverse shock that becomes extremely luminous in X-rays (> 10^39 erg/sec, 0.1-2.4 keV). The X-ray luminosity can be reasonably predicted by detecting the accompanying electron synchrotron radio emissions from the shocked regions. We propose AXAF ToO observations of selected categories of SNe to substantially increase the number of X-ray detections (currently at nine). Combined X-ray and radio observations will test theories of the shock mechanism and provide information on the SN progenitor. In addition X-ray spectra of the brighter SNe will constrain the physical properties of the reverse shock region and the SN ejecta.

The X-ray luminosity can be reasonably predicted by detecting the accompanying electron synchrotron radio emissions from the shocked regions. We propose AXAF ToO observations of selected categories of SNe to substantially increase the number of X-ray detections (currently at nine). Combined X-ray and radio observations will test theories of the shock mechanism and provide information on the SN progenitor. In addition X-ray spectra of the brighter SNe will constrain the physical properties of the reverse shock region and the SN ejecta.

         769        2533 The Crab Nebula offers a unique opportunity to study the physics of pulsar winds and relativistic plasmas. Comparison of ROSAT and HST observations reveals a fundamental connection between dynamic optical structure (e.g., wisps moving at 0.5c) and bright X-ray emission (e.g., the well-known X-ray torus). This connection is not surprising because both phenomena reflect the short lifetimes of the most energetic particles in the nebula. In an approved HST program we will monitor the Crab at 10-day intervals during 8 months in 1998-99. Here we request 5 AXAF ACIS visits to the Crab during this time. This X-ray/optical campaign offers a unique opportunity to tie the dynamical structure of the pulsar wind to the evolution of the particle population which is driving those dynamics.

         774        2538 We propose to observe three young type Ia supernova remnants in the Large Magellanic Cloud--N103B, 0519-69.0, and 0509-67.5--with the HETGS. Previous observations have found these remnants to be in nonequilibrium ionization(NEI). Our goal is to determine the level of ionization nonequilibrium through detailed line spectroscopy of the 0.5-2.0 keV band, which is rich in lines of K shell Ne, Mg, and Si, and L shell Fe, and contains powerful diagnostics to constrain NEI parameters. The HEG is required to resolve these features. To maximize the count rate, we offset point to place the energy band of interest on the efficient back-illuminated chip S1. The sources' moderate spatial extent (10-15'') permits the offset without further degradation of the inherent resolution.
         775        2846 We propose a systematic study of the X-ray brightest supernova remnants in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) with the ACIS-I. The specific goals of the proposal are to (1) derive accurate values of the LMC gas-phase metal abundances; (2) confirm the existence of newly processed metals in the interiors of middle-aged SNRs and study the amount and spatial distribution of these ejecta; (3) find and study power-law X-ray emission components that might arise from nonthermal distributions of electrons in pulsar-powered synchrotron nebula or originating through shock acceleration; (4) clarify the evolutionary state of the remnants to better understand the progenitor stars and their effects on the local environment.

         778        2851 One of the major unsolved problems in supernova research concerns the precise nature of the progenitor systems of Type Ia supernovae. We propose AXAF target-of-opportunity observations of a bright Ia supernova in order to better constrain the circumstellar environment of the progenitor and therefore shed light on the nature of the precursor star. The ability of our team to rapidly determine if a particular supernova meets our trigger criteria, coupled with the broadband sensitivity and rapid response of AXAF, means that the proposed observations will be more than an order of magnitude more sensitive than any previous ones obtained in any waveband: X-ray, optical, or radio.

         780        2880 We propose AXAF-ACIS observations of the remnant of the historic supernova SN 386AD and its associated 65~ms X-ray pulsar, recently discovered in the direction of the remnant by ASCA. This is only the second association of a pulsar with a historical supernova, after the Crab. A detection of the pulsar by AXAF will determine the pulsar spin-down rate - and hence its age, surface magnetic field and spin-down luminosity. This observation will also provide a glimpse at a rare, young pulsar-driven plerion and supernova shell system. The high resolution morphology and spectroscopy of the plerion and shell, possible only with AXAF, will provide a unique opportunity for investigating the flow dynamics and composition of a young pulsar's relativistic wind.

         782         680 Starburst-driven winds and superbubbles play a prominent role in the chemical evolution of galaxies and the metal enrichment of the intergalactic medium. In nearby galaxies, enrichment from young star clusters is not detected in the warm phase of the interstellar medium; but the hot phase could well be a reservoir for freshly-ejected metals. We propose to measure the metal mass and Fe to alpha-element ratio in the hot outflow from NGC1569. This dwarf galaxy is better suited to an enrichment measurement than M82 because the metallicity is lower (thus larger dZ/Z). The gravitational potential is also shallower. The abundance of the X-ray halo is currently unknown because of a degeneracy in the spectral models which we can eliminate by resolving and removing discrete, hard sources.
         783         730 We propose AXAF observations to spatially resolve the emission from X-ray faint early-type galaxies. Their X-ray emission mechanism is not well understood. Unlike the X-ray bright ellipticals in which most of the emission is from hot interstellar gas with T~1 keV, X-ray faint galaxies have hard (~5keV) and very soft (~0.2keV) spectral components. The hard component is assumed to be from low mass X-ray binaries (LMXBs), but the origin of the very soft component is mysterious. We suggested that LMXBs also produce the very soft emission, as it is seen in nearby LMXBs in our Galaxy and in the bulge of M31. These observations should resolve the soft and hard emission into individual sources, and will determine the spectral properties of the LMXBs and/or diffuse thermal gas in these galaxies.

         785         805 Observations of NGC 5846 and NGC 4649, two X-ray-bright elliptical galaxies with extended emission line filaments and dust, will be used to study the interaction between the hot, X-ray emitting gas and cooler interstellar material. We will determine whether heat conduction into the cooler gas or energy losses to grains affect the thermal state of the gas. The elemental abundances and gradients in the hot gas will be derived and compared to the stellar values. If the gas results from local stellar mass loss, the abundances should be similar. If there is a cooling flow, the abundances at each radius should reflect those of stars at larger radii. In these very bright galaxies, inflow of intergalactic gas may also be important; this would produce low abundances with only weak gradients.
         786         862 AXAF's combined high spatial and spectral resolution and wide bandpass make it an unrivalled instrument for the study of X-ray source populations in nearby galaxies. We propose a deep observation of the face-on Local Group spiral galaxy M33 with the primary goals of classifying the bright X-ray sources and of making the most sensitive determination yet of the faint source luminosity function in a late-type spiral. Our secondary goals are to study the M33 hot interstellar medium, to obtain a detailed spectrum of the nuclear source and to detect background AGN which may be used as probes of the M33 ISM.

         788         917 We propose to address in detail the nature of unexpected morphological similarites between different phases of the ISM in early type galaxies. We aim at obtaining good statistics for detailed morphological comparison in 2 galaxies, NGC 5846 and NGC 1553, for which ROSAT data have already established a close relation between warm and hot gas emission, and at a reliable assessing of the spectral parameters in several regions corresponding to high and low surface brightness features. This study will enable us to establish which is the causal link between optical nebulosity, X-ray emisison from hot gas, and dust in early-type galaxies.
         789         927 Previous x-ray observations of SQ have shown that its emission is very complex, and suggest that a substantial fraction is most likely caused by the interaction between group members. With this ACIS-S-BI observation, we aim at a good morphological study of SQ, which extends at determining whether a truly diffuse component is present, and at a reliable determination of the spectral characteristics of some of its components, to gain a proper understanding on the nature of each component. This has strong implications for our understanding 1) of the physics of high velocity galaxy collisions (both old and new) and 2) of the evolutionary history and current state of SQ that may be relevant for the entire class of S-dominated groups.
         790        1089 A popular paradigm is that supernova-driven `superwinds' have chemically-enriched the IGM and have affected the chemical evolution of galaxies. We propose to test this idea by measuring the heavy-element content of the superwind in the prototypical starburst galaxy NGC 253. Prior X-ray data have demonstrated the spectral/spatial complexity of starbursts, but can not provide model-independent measurements of abundances. The unprecedented spatial resolution and good energy resolution of AXAF will finally allow us to determine chemical abundances in a superwind and determine if the flow will escape the galaxy. To meet these goals we propose a 120 ks observation of NGC 253 with ACIS-S, using the high efficiency of the BI chips to obtain high S/N,spatially-resolved spectra of the hot gas.
         791        1159 We propose AXAF ACIS observations of the two brightest elliptical galaxies which have very low metal abundance determinations (~0.1 solar) for their X-ray emitting gas. Both galaxies have high quality optically determined stellar abundance profiles, indicating ~solar central stellar abundances. The high spatial and spectral resolution of AXAF ACIS observations will allow us to directly compare the metal abundance of the X-ray emitting gas to the stellar metallicity at a range of radii within the optical half light radii. This is a companion proposal to one in which the target galaxies have a much smaller disparity in their measured stellar and gaseous abundances.
         792        1213 We propose to observe a supergiant shell within the nearby (3.2 Mpc) dwarf galaxy IC 2574. It coincides with a cavity in HI and is surrounded by HII regions. The region is detected with IRAS, in the radio continuum, with the EINSTEIN satellite and with ROSAT. It is the most active star forming region in IC 2574. ROSAT PSPC data (60 counts) suggest that the cavity is filled with a hot plasma. An AXAF pointed observation with the ACIS-S-BI CCD chip S3 of 10 ksec integration time is requested to confirm the extended nature of the source, to determine its thermal spectrum to an accuracy of 10%, and to check for the contribution from unresolved sources.
         793        1466 We propose to obtain ACIS-I images of the nearby starburst galaxies NGC 253 and NGC 5236 (M83). Detection of supernova remnants and an extended hot wind will be compared to our GTO NICMOS emission line observations of [FeII] and H$_2$, showing SN remnants in [FeII] and the interactions of the hot ISM with molecular matter. The hard X-ray component will be used to identify binaries and estimate the strength of an inverse Compton component. By comparing the properties and numbers of the X-ray sources with predictions of evolutionary starburst models we will constrain the starburst models in a new and powerful way. In turn, the more accurate starburst models can be used as templates for starburst evolution studies in general.
         794        1498 Superbubble breakout is thought to be the central process in releasing metal-rich gas from the disk to the halo of spiral galaxies. Hot X-ray emitting halos were detected around a few edge-on spirals, lending support to this picture, although the gaseous mass was less than anticipated. The proposed observation of the edge-on spiral NGC 891 will answer several fundamental issues: identifying regions of superbubble breakout; testing whether the gas is flowing up as a "fountain"; and determining if accretion onto the galaxy occurs. Also, we can determine the shape of the gravitating mass of this spiral by measuring the temperature distribution of the halo gas. Finally, we will continue our study of SN 1986J, defining its evolution and discriminating between competing models.
         795        1512 The X-ray emission from the bulges of Sa galaxies consists of a hard 5-10 keV component, generally attributed to low mass X-ray binaries (LMXBs) and a soft 0.2 keV component of unknown origin. It is possible that the soft emission is from a warm ISM. However, we suggest that the soft emission also results from LMXBs. AXAF will be able to resolve the soft emission into point sources, and determine the spectral properties of the brighter LMXBs. Alternatively, if the soft emission is diffuse, the temperature of the warm gas will be determined. If Sa bulges are lacking an ISM, this implies that galactic winds have driven the gas lost from stars out of the galaxy. Since the L_X/L_B values of Sa bulges vary by a factor of 2, this would also imply there is not a universal stellar L_X/L_B value.
         796        1533 Embedded in a large HI primordial cloud, with a metallicity of only Z(Sun)/41 and a stellar population not older than 100 Myr, the blue compact dwarf galaxy SBS 0335-052 is one of only two known examples of nearby young dwarf galaxies. The formation of the hot gas phase is one of the most fundamental processes in the early period of galaxy formation. Thus, its study in a very metal-deficient environment and during the early evolution phase of a galaxy is crucial for understanding the X-ray properties of high redshift galaxies. We wish to study the respective contributions of point sources and diffuse emission to the X-ray luminosity, the time evolution of the X-ray properties, and check for a possible galactic wind .
         797        1555 NGC4631, a nearby edge-on galaxy at a high Galactic latitude, is an ideal site for studying hot galactic-halo gas and its interplay with various other galactic components (e.g., magnetic field and extended warm gas features) involved in disk/halo interaction. We propose an AXAF ACIS observation to obtain spatially-resolved spectroscopic data. Complemented by our extensive multiwavelength database on the galaxy, the data will enable us to study the structure, ionization status, and energy balance of the hot gas as well as its role in disk/halo interaction.
         798        1598 We propose to obtain deep ACIS-S-BI CCD data of the X-ray bright elliptical galaxy NGC 5044 which also exhibits extensive optical emission-line filaments and dust patches. These data will not only significantly improve on the morphological study of the X-ray emission of elliptical galaxies at higher spatial resolution than that available to date, but will also allow a study of the spectral characteristics of the X-ray emission on very small and interesting scales, which will allow us for the first time to study the physical nature of the connection between the different phases of the interstellar medium of elliptical galaxies.
         799        2114 We propose to observe NGC1395, a low X-ray luminosity, "normal" elliptical (E2) galaxy with a rotation velocity of ~100 km/sec to address four fundamental questions. How much dark matter is in its halo? What is the source of the ``hard'' spectral component found in ASCA observations of elliptical galaxies? What are the heavy element abundances in the X-ray gas, what is the abundance distribution, and what do these imply about the supernova enrichment history? Do central cooling flows occur in low luminosity, rotating galaxies?
         800        2340 We propose a deep (50ks) ACIS observation of the z=2.72 Lyman break galaxy cB58. Gravitational lensing by the foreground galaxy cluster MS1512 has boosted the flux by a factor of 40, allowing this high redshift galaxy to be studied in exquisite detail. The unique imaging capabilities of AXAF will enable us to derive the X-ray luminosity, which in turn will give an independent measure of the star formation rate. Comparison with the far-UV luminosity will then provide the first reliable determination of the UV attenuation by dust. This will allow an estimate of the correction to the comoving star formation rate at z~3. The soft X-ray spectrum may also allow us to place an upper limit on the neutral hydrogen column density and hence constrain the metallicity of the interstellar gas.
         801        2599 We propose to observe four galaxies from a unique sample of 21 nearby, isolated ellipticals for which we have extensive optical and IR data. Our project has two broad goals: (1) to determine the X-ray properties of isolated ellipticals and compare them with ellipticals in the richer environments of groups and clusters and (2) to search for a diffuse X-ray halo characteristic of an intragroup medium which would provide direct evidence that ellipticals can evolve from the merger of poor groups. AXAF will provide us with the spatial and spectral resolution necessary to study how the X-ray luminosity, temperature, and metallicity vary within such galaxies and their halos.

         803        2697 We propose to measure the heavy element abundance distributions for a bright elliptical galaxy NGC5846 and a ram-pressure stripped elliptical in the Virgo cluster, NGC4374 (M84). The AXAF spatial resolution and sensitivity will allow a direct comparison of stellar abundances measured optically with X-ray measurements for the hot corona. These observations will determine the relative contributions to the enrichment of the ISM from different types of supernovae. These measurements also will test various chemical enrichment scenarios.
         804        2925 Our primary goal is to characterize the spatial distribution and spectral characteristics of the hot interstellar plasma in spiral galaxies. Since it is difficult to see soft X-rays coming from distances > ~ 100 pc from the Sun in the disk of our Galaxy, we propose to observe the hot interstellar plasma in several nearby face-on spiral galaxies. The hot phase of the interstellar medium of normal spiral galaxies is not well characterized or understood, but if the local filling fraction is representative of the Galactic value, its role is fundamental in the evolution of the interstellar medium. A secondary goal is to constrain the cosmological extragalactic diffuse background below 0.5 keV by quantifying its absorption by these intervening galaxies.
         805        3047 I Zw 18 is the most metal-poor galaxy known so far. It was interpreted as a young galaxy, which is incompatible with its recently observed high carbon abundance. Kpc-sized expanding shells and the newly detected extended X-ray emission indicate that I Zw 18 is experiencing a large scale outflow of gas into its halo. If it can be shown, that the metals created by the starburst are locked in the hot gas, the evolutionary state of I Zw 18 could be understood. We propose an AXAF study of I Zw 18 using ACIS-S to accurately determine the properties of the diffuse hot gas in I Zw 18 and its halo. Combined with HST data on the warm ionized gas and stellar content, this will sensitively probe the evolutionary state of I Zw 18 and test the galactic wind paradigm of dwarf galaxy evolution.
         806         683 The nearby radio galaxy Centaurus A contains the closest extragalactic jet that can be studied in X-rays. In particular, the Cen A filaments offer a unique laboratory to investigate the detailed physics of the interaction of a jet of relativistic plasma with a dense cloud in the interstellar medium of the galaxy. We intend to prove whether the optical filamentary emission is excited by radiative shocks or by the UV radiation from the nuclear source. The predicted X-ray emission from the fast shock model is just below the sensitivity limit of previous searches, and is expected to be concentrated into thin filamentary sheets. If X-rays remain undetected by this measurement, the excitation mechanism has to be due to hard photons.
         807         699 Low-ionization nuclear emission regions (LINERs) are quite common, occuring in at least 1/3 of all galaxies, and more frequently in specific galaxy types. The nature of the undrlying power source remains controversial since photionization from a low-luminosity AGN, photoionization by hot stars, and shock ionization are all plausible excitation mechanisms of the line-emitting gas. LINERs may well be a heterogeneous population. We propose to observe a small sample of 4 such objects with ACIS-I to address the question of their power source. We will exploit the ability of AXAF to deliver high-resolution X-ray images as well as spatially resolved spectra up to 10 keV to test the competing scenarios.

         809         795 Mrk 273 is an ultraluminous IRAS galaxy undergoing a major merger. A unique soft X-ray source Mrk 273x, 1.3' to the northeast of Mrk 273, was discovered by us. The optical counterpart is a nucleated dwarf galaxy with strong emission lines, typical for Seyfert galaxies. The X-ray luminosity is more than two orders of magnitude higher than that from any other dwarf galaxy. We propose to observe the Mrk 273 system with a 50ksec exposure using the ACIS imaging array, centered on the dwarf Seyfert galaxy. The observation will be used to study the spatial distribution, spectral shape and time variability of Mrk 273x and Mrk 273. Understanding of this system has important implications for the formation of nucleated dwarf galaxies and, if such sources are common, the cosmic X-ray background.
         810         864 A deep HRC-S+LETG image will be made of the twisted, X-ray emitting jets of NGC 4258. The X-ray jets are 3.5-arcmin long, several arcsecs wide, and are prominent in radio continuum, optical emission line, and soft X-ray images. They are known to have thermal X-ray spectra, kinematical discontinuities, and gaseous excitation consistent with high-velocity (500-700 km/s) entraining shocks. Our AXAF grating exposure will have sufficient counts and spectral resolution to establish shock velocities and gas abundances at a dozen points in the jet flow. These data will be used to constrain the time evolution of the outflow, and hence the dynamical evolution of the AGN. There will be general insights on jet entrainment and shock physics in other astrophysical contexts.
         811        1009 We request AXAF observations of TON S180 & Mkn 279, for which FUSE time is guaranteed as part of the PI program. We propose simultaneous FUSE, AXAF & STIS observations to resolve the conflict between the steep EUV continuum derived from composite spectra of QSOs and the weakness of the He II lines then predicted by photoionization models. These observations will also test the claim that the intrinsic XUV spectra of narrow-line and normal Seyfert 1 galaxies differ. Our targets have minimal soft X-ray absorption and are the brightest objects in their class in the EUV. Hence they provide the best opportunity for determining the intrinsic XUV spectra in individual objects.
         812        1107 The most extreme objects in the class of ``Narrow-Line'' Seyfert 1 galaxies (NLS1) show absorption features which are probably due to oxygen in a relativistic wind outflowing from the nucleus. The features are blueshifted to 1-1.5 keV and therefore occur close to the peak efficiency of the MEG. We propose to use that instrument to confirm the features and measure their energy, strength and profiles to probe this unusual relativistic flow, which may represent an analogue of the BAL phenomenon observed in the UV.
         813        1128 We propose a short-exposure AXAF survey of a sample of 16 bright Broad Absorption Line (BAL) QSOs. BALs are caused by outflows from the nucleus with velocities reaching 0.2c. Recent ROSAT studies imply that the soft X-ray continuum of BALQSOs is either a) strongly absorbed by highly ionized material, or b) intrinsically underluminous. Since about 10% of QSOs show BALs, the former interpretation supports the hypothesis that most or possibly all QSOs contain BAL-type outflows, with a 10% covering factor. BALQSOs may thus provide a unique probe of cloud conditions near the nucleus of most QSOs. The latter alternative means that BALQSOs are an intrinsically different type of quasar. We propose to settle this question finally, with a judicious application of AXAF's unique capabilities.

         823        1152 We propose AXAF observation of the gravitationally lensed quasar Q2237+0305 (Einstein Cross) during a microlensing event. We will monitor the four images of the QSO from the ground regularly to ascertain the onset of a microlensing event. As the microlensing event occurs, we will measure the variations of X-ray intensity and spectra with AXAF and compare with those taken after the event. Since only a small region of the QSO accretion disk is strongly magnified during a microlensing event, we will be able to limit the size of X-ray emitting regions of the QSO and thus the mass which is contained on scales of several AUs. If observed simultaneously with ground-based telescopes and with HST, furthermore, we will also be able to probe multi-wavelength emission properties of QSOs.

         827        1204 A ROSAT HRI observation of the powerful nearby (z=0.1744) FR II radiogalaxy 3C 219 has revealed the presence of complex extended soft X-ray emission which appears to be aligned with the radio axis. It has been proposed that extended soft X-ray emission may originate by inverse Compton scattering of the nuclear radiation field by the relativistic electrons in the radio lobes. We propose an ACIS-S-BI observation of 3C 219 to study the spatial and spectral properties of the extended emission. AXAF offers the unique opportunity to disentangle the nuclear and the extended component with arcsecond resolution to obtain spatially resolved X-ray spectroscopy. Such an observation will allow to test the origin of the X-ray emission in this radiogalaxy.
         828        1240 Synchrotron radiation at optical and X-ray wavebands provides important constraints on the location and nature of particle and acceleration processes in jets; X-ray jets are particularly important because of the very short synchrotron lifetimes of X-ray emitting electrons. Only two such jets are known, in the nearby (and atypical) sources M87 and Cen A. Here we propose observations which we expect to detect an X-ray jet in the archetypal twin-jet radio galaxy 3C 66B, known to have an optical jet. AXAF's spatial resolution is critical for this project; using it, we will be able to locate the sites of X-ray emission and thus strongly constrain or reject models in which particles are accelerated at the knots in the jet, thought to correspond to internal shocks.
         829        1241 Observations of synchrotron-self-Compton (SSC) emission from the hot spots of powerful extragalactic radio sources are vital for a measurement of the magnetic field strength in these components; without this the dynamics and energetics of these sources are very poorly constrained. With previous X-ray observatories only one such measurement has been made (in the powerful radio source Cygnus A). We now propose observations of the radio galaxy 3C 123 which will detect SSC emission from the hot spot and enable an accurate measurement of the magnetic field strength. 3C 123 is the most suitable object in the sky, after Cygnus A, for such a study. A by-product of our observations will be data on the X-ray core and environment of 3C123 which will shed new light on its peculiar radio structure.
         830        1267 The radiation mechanism of collimated plasma outflows (jets) from active galactic nuclei are still far from beeing understood. Especially the X-ray emission reported from jets raises questions on the nature of the acceleration mechanism and the radiation process at work. Recently, X-ray emission from the jet/hotspot region of 3C 390.3 was reported. This is for the first time an X-ray source which is close to the hotspot of a jet. We propose to observe the hotspot/jet source with AXAF for 35 ksec in order to obtain the X-ray spectrum and to map the extended structure indicated by the ROSAT HRI. We would like to identify the source and distinguish several possible scenarios of its nature.
         831        1369 We propose 50-ks LETG/ACIS-S observations of the Seyfert Galaxy NGC 3516. The source is one of the brightest of its kind, contains a strong ``Warm Absorber'', and the galactic column is relatively small. We will also obtain guaranteed HST-STIS observations. The AXAF observations will allow us to measure between 4 and 9 emission lines (depending on their width), several absorption and emission edges, and X-ray absorption lines if present in the spectrum. We will determine the level of ionization and perhaps the metallicity. We will also measure line and edge widths and, if the X-ray lines are less than 4000 km/sec wide, the gas motion. This will give the best ever obtained indication of the WA location and will allow us to estimate the mass of the emitting material.
         832        1458 Recent X-ray observations of BALQSOs indicate absorbing columns that are 2 or more orders of magnitude larger than previous estimates from the UV absorption lines. This huge discrepancy must be resolved if we are to understand even the most basic properties of BAL winds (eg. their mass, location, acceleration, ionization, etc.). I recently used high-quality HST spectra of the bright (V = 15.8), low redshift (z_abs = 0.87) BALQSO PG 1254+047 to derive much larger column densities from the BALs, invoking new evidence that the lines are more optically thick than they appear. I now propose AXAF/ACIS-S observations to 1) test my BAL analysis and 2) place unprecedented constraints on the wind parameters and on the relationship between the UV and X-ray absorbers.
         833        1461 We will combine new AXAF/ACIS-S-BI spectra with existing and forthcoming HST UV spectra to study the extreme high-velocity absorber (detached by ~56,000 km/s from the emission redshift) in the bright (V = 16.0) QSO, PG 2302+029. The UV line profiles have moderate widths (FWHM ~ 4000 km/s) but the outflow velocities are higher than in any previously measured system. Our combined X-ray and UV observations should 1) determine for the first time if there is OUTFLOWING X-ray absorption in QSOs, 2) improve our understanding of QSO metal abundances, and 3) yield the best information to date on the physical conditions, the acceleration mechanism(s), and the relationship between UV and X-ray absorption in QSO outflows.
         834        1469 ROSAT PSPC and HRI observations of the low-power radio galaxies NGC~6251 (z=0.0234) and NGC~4261 (z=0.0089) have shown complicated X-ray structures and spectra. In both objects we find an extended atmosphere and a small-scale bright component associated with the active nucleus. However, the interpretation of this nuclear X-ray emission is complicated by the presence of multiple spectral components, and has remained ambiguous in the absence of X-ray data with good spatial and spectral resolution. Here we propose ACIS observations of these galaxies to determine the fraction of their core X-radiation which originates in non-thermal processes, and to study the gas components of the cores and envelopes. X-ray emission from the jets will also be detectable.
         835        1474 The overall aim of this proposal is to understand the nature of ultraluminous IRAS galaxies (ULIRGs) with double nuclei. The presence of two nuclei, one of which is already known to be an AGN, seems to be a common property of ULIRGs. Existing ASCA spectra reveal both hard and soft components, however the spatial resolution of AXAF is essential if we are to determine the relative X-ray fractions emitted by each nucleus. The spectral information will be used to determine the origin of the hard and soft components ie. whether they are AGN or starburst related. For the first time we shall unambiguously separate the AGN and starburst X-ray activity in these systems of high bolometric luminosity.

         837        1601 Controversy surrounds the EXOSAT discovery of a QPO (period ~500 s) in NGC 5548 due to the data being plagued by high background and instrumental systematics. If the NGC 5548 QPO is real, the implications for the physics of the X-ray emission mechanism and inner-most disk/black-hole system are enormous. AXAF provides the first opportunity to settle the issue, capable of yielding power spectra with unprecedented sensitivity, pushing the limit on finding new features. Using HETG/ACIS we will also perform time-resolved spectroscopy of the ionized absorption features and Fe-K emission line, search for energy-dependent time lags in the continuum, between the continuum and spectral features, and between the spectral features. These data will provide powerful constraints on models of AGN.
         838        1612 We propose ACIS imaging and spectroscopy of four powerful radio galaxies at $z > 0.4$ to separate their cluster and AGN components and address their unification with quasars. The observations will test our tentative result, based on ROSAT data, that the relationship between Doppler-boosted radio and X-ray emission in flat-spectrum radio quasars extends to powerful radio galaxies. The ACIS data will make the first measurements of the gas temperatures for distant clusters selected as hosts of powerful radio sources (and so provide information on the cosmological evolution of active-galaxy environments) and test the idea that the presence of cooling gas is required to trigger the most powerful radio sources.

         840        1682 Blazars are an important class of AGN, offering a view of the energy producing region near the central black hole. They are often found in poor galaxy clusters, but intrinsic cluster properties are largely unknown. The environment may play a role in determining the different blazar types and can tell us more about the parent population. We propose to observe the environments of blazars with the AXAF ACIS-I imager. Our complete sample of 12 objects, unbiased with respect to the optical environment, spans all spectral energy distributions and luminosities. We will detect cluster gas to below the expected luminosity for poor clusters, and constrain its extent, temperature, mass, and density.

         846        1871 If FR~I radio galaxies and BL~Lac objects are parts of a single population, and only their orientation causes them to appear different (the BL~Lac ``unification'' scheme), then they should have the same isotropic properties. We recently extended existing radio and optical tests to the X-ray by searching near BL~Lacs for X-ray emission which matches the X-ray envelopes of FR~I objects found by Worrall \& Birkinshaw (1994). The well-known object PKS~0521-365 shows an unexpectedly strong halo when observed with the ROSAT HRI. Here we propose to use ACIS-I to obtain images and spectroscopy for PKS~0521-365 and three other BL Lacs. The data will determine the physical relationship between halos and their AGN and test the unification scheme.
         847        1875 This proposal is concerned with an AXAF ACIS-I X-ray observation of one of the most prominent giant radio galaxies, NGC6251. Using ROSAT PSPC data we could recently verify that this galaxy hosts a huge X-ray halo and an X-ray jet, the latter with a very close correlation to the radio jet out to a radial distance of 180 kpc. The high sensitivity and the excellent spectral resolution of the AXAF ACIS-I telescope detector system will provide us with the data to discern - beyond any doubts - the origin of the X-ray emission from the 180 kpc X-ray jet. The huge dimensions of NGC6251 offer the unique opportunity to study, in great detail, its characteristics which can be regarded as an archetypical scenario of radio jets associated with X-ray emission.
         848        1914 We propose to measure the fraction of X-ray flux in resolved vs. unresolved components for three representative BL Lacs: an LBL, an HBL and an intermediate object. These measurements will be used to test the assumptions of the two leading unified scheme models. If LBLs and HBLs differ by orientation, then the relativistic jets must be accelerating and the X-ray Doppler factors will be smaller than the radio Doppler factors for a given object. If the SED-based unified scheme is instead correct, then the X-ray and radio Doppler factors for a given object should be the same. In addition, we will obtain direct measurements of the diffuse X-ray luminosity which we will compare with exisiting measurements for FRI radio galaxies and evaluate the assumptions of the BL Lac/FRI unified scheme.

         850        1931 We propose AXAF ACIS-I observations of several newly discovered radio-loud Broad Absorption Line QSOs (BAL QSOs). Previous ROSAT observations of radio-quiet BAL QSOs, which were the only kind known until recently, show that they are X-ray quiet compared to normal radio-quiet QSOs. This surprising result implies BAL QSOs are either (1) intrinsically X-ray-quiet, or (2) absorbed by high column density material (N_H ~ 10^23 cm^-2). ASCA Observations of PHL 5200 suggest the latter. Because Radio-loud QSOs are more X-ray bright than radio-quiet QSOs, AXAF is able to obtain spectra of our radio-loud BAL QSOs in modest exposure times and verify that they are normal but absorbed radio-loud QSOs. These data will help us to understand the relationship between QSO absorption and radio properties.

Because Radio-loud QSOs are more X-ray bright than radio-quiet QSOs, AXAF is able to obtain spectra of our radio-loud BAL QSOs in modest exposure times and verify that they are normal but absorbed radio-loud QSOs. These data will help us to understand the relationship between QSO absorption and radio properties.

         855        1976 We propose ACIS imaging and spectroscopy to separate the physically-distinct emission components that are confused in ROSAT HRI and PSPC images and spectra of the cores of B2 radio galaxies. We will use the ACIS high spatial resolution to resolve the cooling flows that we believe are present in some cases (and which may be a vital component of the jet-formation process) and separate them from the non-thermal AGNs. The ACIS spectral resolution will be used to measure the temperature of the gas and the spectra of the small-scale AGNs. The data obtained will further our study of the relationships between B2 radio galaxies and BL Lac objects and test the possibility that X-ray elongations seen in some ROSAT HRI images are related to the radio structures.

         859        1985 We propose to make the first grating-resolution X-ray spectrum of NGC 4051 with the AXAF LETG. This bright Seyfert 1 has a low Galactic column and a complex X-ray spectrum. Oxygen edges are seen from a `warm absorber' and additional poorly-understood spectral features are also seen. We will resolve and model the spectral complexity to determine its nature. We expect O, Ne, C and other X-ray lines from the warm absorber, and we will use line energies/widths to constrain the bulk velocity/velocity dispersion of the warm absorber. X-ray line strengths will constrain the warm absorber covering factor, and we will critically examine if the warm absorber is in photoionization equilibrium. We will also obtain HST STIS spectra to study UV absorption and test the UV/X-ray absorber model.
         860        2030 The nearby Sb galaxy, NGC 3227, is an interesting source in many wavebands, and could represent a transitional Seyfert galaxy. Recent X-ray observations show the source to exhibit extreme spectral variability on a timescale of years. Most significantly the X-ray spectrum appears to change from a Seyfert 1-like to a more Seyfert 2-like form. Here we propose a 50ks ACIS-S/HETG observation of NGC 3227 in order to perform an exploratory spectroscopic study. The proposed observations will provide our first insights as to how and why the ionized, circumnuclear material in NGC 3227 might differ from that seen in other objects.
         861        2046 We propose to image the wide (7'') separation quasar pair Q2345+007 to determine whether it is a binary quasar or a gravitational lens and to probe the nature of the lensing matter. With nearly identical optical spectra and identical redshifts, this quasar pair remains the most intriguing example of an observed configuration requiring the presence of massive, concentrated dark matter acting as a gravitational lens. If the quasar pair Q2345+007 proves consistent with a lens in X-rays, we expect to constrain, detect, or characterize the most compelling ``dark cluster'' candidate known. If not, our observation will lend credence to the binary interpretation, showing Q2345+007 to be a bizarre case of virtually identical spectral energy distributions in quasars separated by about 3Mpc.
         862        2166 We have recently discovered absorption features near 1 keV in the ASCA spectra of three Narrow-line Seyfert 1 galaxies (NLS1s). Plausible explanations for this feature are oxygen continuum or resonance line absorption by relativistically outflowing gas, but absorption by material overabundant in iron cannot be ruled out. We propose 100 ks HETG observations of the brighter two of these objects, 1H 0707-495 and IRAS 13224-3809, to determine the origin of this feature. These objects also show the steepest spectra and highest amplitude variability of the NLS1s observed by ASCA, and therefore identification of this feature could be an important clue for understanding these enigmatic objects. Analysis and interpretation will be enhanced by our upcoming HST STIS observations of these
         863        2168 We propose a 50 ks HETG observation to identify an unusual emission feature near 1 keV found in the ASCA and SAX spectra of the bright narrow-line Seyfert 1 galaxy Ark 564. This could be the first clear evidence of the predicted soft X-ray line emission from an ionized accretion disk, which would support the idea that NLS1s are characterized by a high accretion rate. Alternatively, we may discover that this feature originates in emission from a warm absorber with unusual ionization conditions, thereby permitting our study of a broader range of warm absorber behavior. Ark 564 is bright enough that we will also be able to study its X-ray variability and search for the nonlinearity which may be a signature of NLS1s.
         864        2227 We propose a 50 ks ACIS-I observation of the megamaser Seyfert 2 galaxy NGC 4945, in order to understand the nature and physical conditions of the putative scattering medium, postulated to exist along the axis of the system; with the measured mass of the black hole via megamaser observations, a detailed study of this object is particularly fruitful. This observation will also allow an investigation of the starburst/superwind activity known to exist in the circumnuclear region.
         865        2261 We propose to measure the X-ray absorbing column associated with moderate redshift, intervening damped Lyman alpha and 21-cm quasar absorption line systems. The advantage of the X-ray absorption is that it gives a measure of the metal column density (mainly oxygen) and hence abundance, which is independent of ionization, inclusion of the atoms in a molecule, or depletion onto dust grains. We estimate that we will detect absorption if the gas is 1/8 solar or greater for one system at z=0.3 and 1/4 solar or greater for another at z=0.4. For two other objects, we request short exposures with ACIS-S to measure the spectral energy distribution in order to access the feasibility of future grating observations.

         868        2275 This proposal is to observe with AXAF ACIS-I two narrow line type 1 AGN which showed in previous ROSAT PSPC and BeppoSAX MECS observations evidence of extended emission, or of a high density of surrounding point sources, on scales of a few arcmin. These observations can help in assessing the origin of the emission observed between 0.1 and 10 keV around these AGN and in understanding whether there is a connection between these peculiar active nuclei and their environment.
         869        2282 We propose to observe Arp 220, the prototypical ULIRG, with AXAF with three complementary goals: (1) To detect or set strong limits on the hard X-ray emission from any dust-obscured AGN. This will finally settle the issue of the importance of an AGN in Arp 220 and other ULIRGs. (2) To examine the role of the hot interstellar medium in galaxy mergers. Of special importance is matching high resolutiuon AXAF images to HST and ground-based data to determine the role of dust, proto-globulars, and other features in the X-ray emission. (3) To determine the physical state of the extended superwind and look for any interaction with the Intergalactic Medium. We aim to understand the interaction between Arp 220 and its environment and thus the origin and fate of this highly luminous recent merger.
         870        2327 It is not clear whether the large numbers of very low-luminosity LINER-like galactic nuclei are really AGN or not. We propose AXAF observations of the nearest known such objects, most of which have known weak nuclear soft X-ray sources, aimed primarily at (a) testing whether the X-ray sources are compact or extended, and (b) looking for much stronger but absorbed hard X-ray sources. If instead the "activity" is due to some sort of starburst, choosing the very nearest examples should give us the best chance of resolving this activity - even for the most distant objects in our sample, 1kpc is 30 arcsec. We should be able to detect individual X-ray binaries and supernova remnants to approximately 10e37 erg/s.

         873        2582 X-ray spectra of Seyfert II galaxies exhibit discrete spectral features in the soft X-ray band. The line formation mechanisms are not well understood and detailed spectroscopy will provide a wealth of information about the structure of the circumnuclear regions. Mkn 3 is one of the brightest Seyfert II galaxies in soft X-rays and we propose an AXAF observation with the HETGS to obtain high resolution X-ray spectra of the emission-line regions in Mkn 3. Our primary goal is to determine the underlying line emission mechanisms and to constrain the ionization structure of the active nucleus.
         874        2584 We propose observations of two high redshift (z=0.8,z=1.8), powerful blazar AGN. The AGN are strong EGRET sources, with hard spectra extending to at least 10 GeV. If their emission extends significantly past 20 GeV, these AGN will be surrounded by X-ray halos produced by cascading of >20 GeV energy photons on diffuse IR/O background radiation. The halo structure depends on the local (high redshift) IR/O background and the intergalactic magnetic field. We will be able to map out the X-ray structure of these AGNs' radio jets (one of which shows bending) on scales directly comparable to VLA ones. We can also follow rapid variations in the blazar spectra, including (in one case) those at optical wavelengths. These blazars are likely in rich clusters, and we might detect cluster gas.
         875        2618 We propose to measure the X-ray flux of 27 previously undetected, bright, radio quiet quasars with $z>4$. To date, only 6 radio quiet quasars with $z>4$ have been detected in X-rays. We draw our sample from the objects whose emission line spectra have been observed by Shields and Hamman with Keck and the MMT. These well-studied objects form the definitive sample of the highest redshift quasars known.

         882        2891 The nearby dwarf spiral galaxy NGC 4395 harbors the least luminous Seyfert 1 nucleus known. In the soft X-ray band, NGC 4395 is quite remarkable. It is rapidly variable, and its spectrum is exceedingly flat for an AGN, exhibiting an unusually strong absorption feature due to intervening ionized gas. Deep AXAF observations will allow us to investigate whether the flat spectrum of this unique object extends to higher energies and if, like other AGNs, it possesses an Fe K emission line. These results will help us to better understand the structure and energetics of NGC 4395's nucleus, as well as insight into the nature of active galaxies at the very bottom of the AGN luminosity function and their contribution to the cosmic X-ray background.
         883        2905 We propose a 50 ks observation of the Seyfert 2 galaxy NGC 2110 with the HRMA+ACIS-S BI combination to investigate the detailed X-ray properties of the large-scale outflow powered by the AGN. We will study the X-ray properties of extended emission on scales smaller than ~0.5 kpc (the size of the extended emission as deduced from ROSAT HRI observations). X-ray studies of starburst galaxies show that starburst-powered outflows are very common in starburst galaxies (e.g., Dalhem et al. 1998), but little attention has been paid to the large-scale properties of AGN-driven outflows. Are they similar to starburst-driven `superwinds' or are they similar to AGN-driven jets? NGC 2110 has an AGN-powered outflow and we seek to determine the physical and X-ray properties of the outflow.
         884        2963 The aim of this proposed AXAF-ACIS program is to detect or constrain the amount of low-redshift photoelectric absorption caused by metals in five low-redshift QSO damped Ly-alpha systems. AXAF-ACIS-S (BI) can be used to derive accurate determinations of metal-to-hydrogen ratios in the range 1.0 to 0.1 times solar abundances for the low-redshift systems, providing they have sufficiently high HI column densities. In the HI-disk paradigm for damped systems, metallicities should approach approximately solar abundances. This can be tested. More generally, this program will lead to important empirical results on the chemical enrichment history of the gaseous components of damped Ly-alpha galaxies.

         886        2999 Narrow-line Seyfert 1s have strong, variable soft X-ray excesses and unusually narrow optical emission lines. With a very strong excess and low Galactic column, Mkn 478 is by far the brightest NLS1 at soft X-ray energies. We propose a 75~ksec LETG observation that should yield a spectrum with >30,000 photons, making efficient use of precious AO1 time to study an archetype of this type of AGN. The LETGS's excellent resolution and throughput will allow the first detailed spectral studies of the excess, resolving any blended lines and showing there is a strong soft thermal or nonthermal continuum. Also, the variability of different components could provide key constraints on their sizes.
         887        3027 We propose 4 ACIS-I observations, each of 75ks, centred on sub-areas of an extremely well studied region from the European Large Area ISO Survey (ELAIS). With existing deep ISO observations in the mid-and far-infrared, VLA observations at 20cm, SCUBA sub-millimetre data and accumulating CCD BVRI and near-IR coverage, these fields are ideal for detecting and studying the properties of dust obscured objects. If the hard X-ray background is indeed due to obscured AGN, we will detect dozens of these objects with both ELAIS and AXAF This will provide a clear cut test of this model, and enable us to study the properties of these objects across most of the electromagnetic spectrum.

         889         707 We propose to observe three clusters of galaxies with radio halos : A3667, A2319 and A2255. In the first cluster the extended radio source is located well outside of the central core, while it is at the cluster center in the other two clusters. According to a recent hypothesis, the formation of the radio halos may be attributable to suitable cluster-subcluster merger events and to the presence of tailed radio galaxies as sources of relativistic electrons. The AXAF observatory has the capability to identify the observational signatures of recent merger activity in clusters of galaxies. So, the proposed observations will be crucial in studying the hyphothesis that recent merger events and the formation of Mpc-scale radio halos in rich clusters are linked each other.
         890         733 Central galaxies in rich clusters are sites of cluster cooling flows, with large masses of gas cooling through X-ray temperatures. Many of these galaxies host powerful radio sources. Recent evidence suggests a strong interaction between X-ray gas and radio plasma. The X-ray gas may confine radio lobes, deflect radio jets, and produce Faraday rotation. The radio lobes may displace and compress the X-ray gas; this may lead to enhanced cooling and star formation. We propose AXAF observations of two bright cooling flows (A2029 & A2052) with strong radio sources to image the interaction region with the radio source, and to determine the physical state of the X-ray gas. We will also derive the overall cooling flow properties, including abundance gradients and excess absorption, if any.
         891         779 We propose to obtain a high spatial resolution temperature map of the core of the ``cooling flow'' cluster Abell 2029 to compare with detailed N-body+Hydro simulations on the same scale. Various pieces of evidence (no H$\alpha$ emission, no blue starlight, and the presence of a wide-angle-tail radio source) strongly suggest that the large central X-ray surface brightness excess is NOT due to a cooling with $\dot{\rm{M}} > 100$ M$_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$ but rather due to very hot shocked gas in a cluster-cluster merger. In this scenario filaments seen in the ROSAT HRI image are shock fronts which will remain unresolved with the ACIS-I, producing a spectacular AXAF image. The ACIS-I temperature will discern unambiguously if this cluster is a cooling flow or a merger event.
         892         794 We propose to image a nearby rich double cluster of galaxies, A3125/A3128, with HRC-I. Ground-based optical imaging and spectroscopy, along with a ROSAT PSPC pointed observation, has established that there are at least two major mergers of subclusters ongoing in A3125/A3128 at present. Thus this double cluster represents a particularly favorable case for studying the way in which merging of substructures proceeds in the rich cluster environment. Our goal is to use the high spatial resolution of AXAF to resolve shocks and other transient disturbances in the hot intracluster medium (ICM) of A3125/A3128. These disturbances in the ICM should provide crucial information towards developing a comprehensive picture of the cluster merger phenomenon.

         894         808 Cluster mergers are thought to drive the X-ray evolution of clusters, but to fully understand these events we need to study young mergers. Classical signatures of a merger can last for up to 10^9 yrs. Radio halos, which are thought to be short lived (<10^8 yrs), are now thought to be powered by mergers. This makes these halos ideal indicators of a young merger. Furthermore, irregular radio halos are thought to be much younger than symmetric halos. The clusters with irregular radio halos and high quality X-ray data (A2256 & A754) have had anomalously hot gas (kT >> 8.5 keV) detected in them. We propose to obtain AXAF data for the recent-merger candidate A2255, a cluster with an irregular radio halo and evidence from the ROSAT and ASCA data of an anomalously hot component.
         895         813 Clusters of galaxies sample rare peaks in the primordial matter distribution and, because their evolution is sensitive to the underlying cosmology, accurate cluster mass measurements can place strong constraints on cosmological models. Using AXAF ACIS-I we will observe a sample of distant clusters (0.15<z<0.3) which exhibit strong gravitational lensing. We will measure the total cluster mass in luminous and dark matter as well as the mass, distribution and composition of intra-cluster gas. We will compare lensing and X-ray mass maps and, by resolving the cluster core, we will be able to discriminate between competing mass models with different dark-matter slopes and will sample the 50 kpc scale dark matter core radius inferred from strong lensing.
         896         812 Clusters of galaxies sample rare peaks in the primordial matter distribution and, because their evolution is sensitive to the underlying cosmology, accurate cluster mass measurements can place strong constraints on cosmological models. Using AXAF ACIS-I we will observe a sample of distant clusters (0.15<z<0.3) which exhibit strong gravitational lensing. We will measure the total cluster mass in luminous and dark matter as well as the mass, distribution and composition of intra-cluster gas.

         897         843 A short (6 ks) ROSAT HRI image has revealed striking substructure within the intracluster medium of the galaxy cluster A4059. Two cavities within the X-ray emission are very apparent with the same position angle as the axis of the central radio source, PKS2354-35. By analogy with the Perseus cluster and Cygnus-A, these cavities are likely to be regions of the ICM that have been evacuated by the expanding radio-lobes. We propose 40ks AXAF ACIS observations of this system primarily to study the morphology and spectrum of these cavities and the bounding shocks. The physical nature of the X-ray bar seen in the ROSAT images will also be determined. Furthermore, we can form detailed temperature and absorption maps for this cluster thereby allowing details of the cooling flow to be explored.
         898         869 We propose AXAF observations of the radio galaxy 1138-262 at z = 2.156. We have detected X-ray emission from 1138-262 using the ROSAT HRI. The X-ray, optical, and radio data all favor thermal X-ray emission from a hot cluster atmosphere, although we cannot rule out a contribution from the active nucleus. The X-ray luminosity for 1138-262 is 6.7x10^{44} ergs/sec between 2 and 10 keV. Sensitive, high resolution spectroscopic imaging with AXAF could verify that the X-ray emission from 1138-262 is from a hot cluster atmosphere. If so, then 1138-262 becomes the most distant, by far, of known X-ray emitting clusters. Detecting such a massive collapsed structure at high redshift presents a severe challenge to models of cosmic structure formation using standard cosmologies.
         899         884 The next major step in our understanding of the hydrodynamics of cluster evolution will come from 2-dimensional abundance maps: unobtainable with ASCA but inevitable with AXAF. We propose A3266 as an ideal cluster in which to study a merging system using 2-dimension temperature and abundance maps obtained with the ACIS-I. Recent optical studies show a huge "tidal arm and remarkable velocity substructure". ASCA observations suggest that it is in the midst of a spectacular merger.
         900         976 We propose to study optical depth effects in bright clusters of galaxies using AXAF's ACIS detector. The optical depth for resonance scattering of a few strong Fe-K and Fe-L lines is larger than unity for our targets A 496, MKW3s and A S1101. This allows us to directly measure ionic column densities. Combining these with ionic volume emission measures allows a determination of the Hubble constant, or limits to the turbulence in the cooling flow. The deep exposures that are required allow also the spatial and spectral study of inhomogeneities in the cooling flow on a scale of 10 arcsec.
         901        1359 We propose to observe the cluster A521 (z=0.247) with AXAF/ACIS-I. Our analysis of our so far obtained optical and X-ray data revealed extremely interesting and unique morphological features. They indicate that this cluster is in a highly unrelaxed state and most likely in formation at the crossing of two filaments. Our aim is to determine the thermal structure of this peculiar cluster, in conjonction with high resolution study of the gas distribution. These informations, combined with available optical data, are essential to understand the dynamical state of this cluster and its formation history. The required data quality in X-rays for this kind of investigation can at present only be provide by AXAF.
         902        1360 We propose to obtain a deep X-ray image of MS0451-03, the brightest cluster at z>0.5 in the Einstein Extended Medium Sensitivity Survey. This cluster is in a unique sample of 4 high-z, high-Lx clusters which have been used to test and severely constrain cosmological models. These are the only high-z clusters which can be studied in detail by AXAF. Current GTO observations will not go beyond available ROSAT and ASCA results unless cluster gas is highly filamentary. Since the cosmological tests rely on assumptions about the Mass-Tx relation, we propose a multi-wavelength campaign, with existing SZ imaging, CNOC galaxy catalogs, HST, ROSAT and ASCA data, to exploit AXAF spatial resolution, test these assumptions, and probe the density structure of gas in a cluster at high redshift.
         903        1366 We propose to observe three well-studied cluster gravitational lenses, which are amongst the most X-ray luminous and massive clusters of galaxies known at intermediate redshifts, to determine the (mass-weighted) temperature profiles and total mass profiles in these systems. The observations will permit direct, accurate measurements of the X-ray gas, total mass and metallicity distributions in the clusters, from their core regions (on the scale of tens of kpc) out to the limits of X-ray detection (r ~3Mpc). The data will reveal the impact of cooling flows on X-ray mass measurements for clusters and elucidate the origin of the discrepancies between X-ray and strong lensing masses for systems without cooling flows.
         904        1378 A85 is unusual in having a strong cooling flow and evidence for ongoing mergers. X-ray substructure and ASCA spectra suggest that a subcluster to the south (and possibly another to the SW) are colliding with the main cluster. We will search for shocks and other hydrodynamic features in AXAF images of the region. The two subclusters coincide with two regions of very low frequency radio emission. Such "radio halos" may result from shock acceleration during mergers. We will compare the radio and X-ray images, and limit or detect Inverse Compton X-ray emission in these regions. Detecting IC would allow the cluster magnetic field to be derived. We will also study the cooling flow at the cluster center, and use it to place constraints on the ages and strengths of the mergers.
         905        1505 At optical wavelengths Hickson Compact Group 90 exhibits an unprecedented amount of diffuse intracluster light whose total luminosity is approximately 40% of the group luminosity. Three luminous galaxies, including the hard X-ray source NGC 7172, are currently strongly interacting and merging, producing a substantial amount of tidal debris which comprises the intracluster light. Previous ROSAT HRI observations of HCG 90 hint at the presence of weak, diffuse X-ray emission. We propose to use the AXAF ACIS detector to acquire better data to confirm that HCG 90 has an extended region of X-ray emission with very low value of L_x/L_opt indicating that the ICM in this group is just now in the process of forming and heating as a direct response to strong galaxy-galaxy interactions.
         906        1536 We propose to make definitive x-ray observations of two distant clusters of galaxies, A1995 and A611, in order to measure the spatial distribution of the x-ray emitting intracluster gas and to determine the x-ray temperature profile within each cluster. These x-ray measurements are important because they directly address the systematic uncertainties that are inherent in the use of galaxy clusters and the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich Effect to determine the cosmic distance scale; they will also allow us to independently determine the masses of these galaxy clusters, and to place constraints on the cosmological density parameter, $\Omega_\circ$.
         907        1545 We propose to search for high (z ~ 1) redshift clusters of galaxies in the field of 5 wide-separation `dark' gravitational lens systems, which serve as indicators for the presence of massive intervening objects. The discovery and eventual determination of the space density of these objects has important consequences for cosmology, in particular for the process of structure formation in the Universe, and can serve as a discriminator between its diverse scenarios. We propose a 20 ksec exposure with ACIS-I towards each lens with the goal of establishing the presence or not of X-ray clusters of galaxies in these fields.
         908        1595 Poor clusters may be the best laboratories for studying the effects of environment on galaxy evolution. Some poor clusters are claimed to have cooling flows; however, with current satellites, it is impossible to determine if the central X-ray excess is due to a cooling flow, an AGN, an X-ray luminous galaxy, or all three. We propose to use the high spectral and spatial resolution of AXAF to measure temperature and abundance gradients in poor clusters. We will determine the relative contributions to the central X-ray emission from all three sources listed above. These observations will also allow us to constrain the amount of mixing between the central galaxy and the intracluster medium, and the Lx-Lopt relation for 20-30 idividual galaxies expected to be detected in 3 poor clusters.
         909        1926 We propose a 50ksec ACIS-I observation of the luminous, relaxed, cooling flow cluster ZW3146 at z=0.291 to determine accurate gas temperature, gas density, and heavy element abundance distributions to large radial distances. The X-ray observations will be supplemented with SZ effect and optical weak lensing observations. Together, these observations will constrain cosmological cluster models, test the validity of the universal temperature profile to higher redshift, determine the importance of non-thermal pressure support for the X-ray gas, measure iron abundance distributions and the iron mass in the cluster, detect small scale structure in the cooling core, and determine the radial dependence of the mass deposition rate in the cooling flow.
         910        1932 We propose to study 3 members of a newly discovered class of mass concentrations in the Universe, detected as ROSAT serendipitous extended sources. These are isolated elliptical galaxies surrounded by extended, massive dark matter halos typical of small clusters. These objects have estimated M/L and Mgas/L ratios 5-9 and 2-3 times those of normal clusters, respectively. If high mass values in these extremely relaxed objects are confirmed by AXAF, their very existence would have profound implications. In particular, constraints on Omega from cluster gas fraction and M/L ratios may be invalidated. Also, since there should have been fewer supernovae per unit gas mass in these objects, they provide a unique possibility to separate effects of gravity and galaxy feedback on cluster formation.

         912        1936 Under very general theoretical assumptions, the evolution of the space density of clusters of galaxies is extremely sensitive to cosmological parameters. The most straightforward method of exploiting this sensitivity is through measurements of the X-ray temperature function. The present fractional uncertainty on the density parameter using this approach is about 30% based on a sample of clusters with redshifts less than 0.4. We propose to obtain the temperatures of a complete sample of clusters with a median redshift of greater than 0.7. These observations will determine the density parameter substantially more precisely because of the increased leverage of the higher redshift.

         919        1989 The evidences of the excess absorption at the cluster center have recently been reported for cooling flow clusters. If these are correct, the cooling flow model becomes more firmly supported. However, due to the limitation of spectral resolution, energy band, and spatial resolution, the finer measurements of absorption column density distribution were impossible. Here, we propose the AXAF measuremensts the absorption column density distribution at the central region of several cooling flow clusters, in order to estimate the mass of cooled material and test the ccoling flow model. To determine the column density finely, we utilize the back-illuminated CCD.
         920        2108 Bent-double radio galaxies, distorted by their interaction with a dense intergalactic medium, are unambiguous tracers of the high density Universe. Our VLA FIRST survey allows us to detect and map these sources to high redshifts for the first time. From a sample of several hundred FIRST bent doubles, we have selected ten for followup at Keck and have found that at least eight reside in clusters with redshifts from 0.35-0.85. This new cluster selection technique preferentially finds regions with dense intracluster gas, making them ideal targets for complementing optical- and X-ray-selected clusters in the construction of the L, T, and M functions for clusters at high z.
         921        2336 Most galaxies in the present-day Universe are in compact groups and poor clusters. Groups are thought to be the building blocks from which clusters formed, and they accordingly occupy an important place in the continuum between isolated galaxies and rich clusters. We propose an observation of the compact group HCG 62 with ACIS-S (BI); our purpose is the accurate determination of the abundances of heavy elements as a function of position in the group. This observation exploits the high X-ray brightness of this group and --- with only four members --- its sparseness to understand the relatively low overall metallicity of the intragroup gas, to test whether any abundance variations are associated with individual galaxies, and to trace the origin of the enrichment to type Ia or II SNs.
         922        2355 The most important question concerning cooling flows in clusters of galaxies is the fate of the cooling gas. We will reexamine the evidence for cooling flows in the A2597 and Zw3146 clusters, where the hot gas is apparently cooling at rates of 350-1350 solar masses per year. Star formation is ongoing in their central galaxies at rates of 10-100 solar masses per year. We will determine the state of the hot gas in the cluster cores where star formation is observed, and we will compare the cooling rates and columns of absorbing gas directly to the optically-determined star formation rates. We will search for X-ray emission associated with the radio sources, where accelerated cooling in displaced, shock-compressed gas may be triggering star formation.
         923        2514 X-rays provide diagnostics on the diffuse ICM in virialized galaxy systems and on the nature of compact galaxy groups (CGs). ROSAT detections, luminosities and temperatures have been subject to debate. Do spiral-rich compact groups contain a diffuse and regular ICM, suggesting a virialized core? Are cool CGs under-luminous relative to the cluster L_X-T relation? Does a prototype virialized system at 1 keV show irregularities in its temperature and metallicity maps? We plan to observe four CGs with ACIS: one has never been observed in pointed observations, one has either cool diffuse emission or none, one appears very under-luminous relative to its temperature, and one is the prototype virialized group, with extended, luminous, hot and seemingly regular X-ray emission.
         924        2572 We propose AXAF ACIS observations of four of the the CNOC/EMSS galaxy clusters at 0.18 < z < 0.55. These clusters have already been used in extensive studies of the cluster mass profiles via dynamical, X-ray and gravitational lensing methods. More detailed AXAF observations will allow us to refine our comparisons between these three methods and resolve discrepancies arising from spatial and temperature substructure. Extension of the X-ray profiles to larger radii will allow a more robust determination of the baryon fraction and baryon-to-light ratios for these clusters. Finally, correlations between galaxy properties and X-ray gas densities will allow us to investigate environmental mechanisms for galaxy evolution. We will also make full use of archival observations of this sample.

         927        2908 We propose to obtain a deep image with ACIS-I of a field containing three galaxy clusters at 0.6 < z < 1.3, including the highest-redshift non-AGN cluster. The AXAF image will determine if the known X-ray source at the z=1.3 cluster is extended, resolving the question of whether an intracluster medium is present. The detection of the Fe-K line and the measurement of the temperature in all three clusters will provide unprecedented insight into the metal enrichment and thermal history of the ICM at z > 1. Existing and scheduled observations of this field, including our NICMOS and WFPC2 imaging and Keck spectroscopy, make it ideal for multi-wavelength studies of the distant universe. We waive proprietary rights so as to make a deep AXAF image available to the community during A01.
         928        2916 We propose to obtain ACIS imagery of the cluster MS2137.3-2353. We will measure the soft X-ray absorption due to accumulated cold gas within the cluster. The amount and spatial distribution of the cold gas will be compared with the emission from cooling material to determine whether the absorbing cold gas could have condensed out of the flow. Detection of a significant column of absorbing gas distributed throughout the cooling region would demonstrate that cooling flows deposit most of their material in cold clouds. We will attempt to measure the redshifted O K edge of the cold gas. This measurement would provide definitive evidence that the cold, absorbing gas lies within the cluster.
         929        2992 The discovery of the gravitationally lensed images of back-ground galaxies in distant clusters of galaxies provide a new tool to measure the mass distributions of clusters of galaxies. It has been claimed that the lensing estimates of the cluster mass are systematically a factor of 2-5 larger than those estimated from X-ray observations. Aiming to resolve this problem, a deep pointed observations of the lensing cluster CL0024+17 which has the most ideal configuration of the lensed images, is proposed to measure accurate temperature and X-ray morphology. If CL0024+17 is pointed on the aimpoint of ACIS-S3, a dark lens system MG0023+171 can be covered by ACIS-S0. Therefore, we propose to perform X-ray search for dark lens object of MG0023+171 simultaneously by adjusting a role angle.
         930        2994 Within these two decades a plenty of astronomical phenomena which are caused by gravitational lensing have been reported. In some of those, lensing objects have not been identified in spite of a relatively deep search for lensing objects by optical observations and the yet unknown lensing objects are called "dark lenses". We have been doing a X-ray search for dark lens objects and successfully identified a distant cluster of galaxies as a dark lens object. In this proposal, high resolution X-ray search for two dark lens objects are proposed. For one of the targets, Q2345+007, lensing interpretation for this system is tested by resolving X-ray emission from two images.
         931        3046 Abell 496 shows a central abundance enhancement due to an excess of supernovae Type I ejecta. The mechanisms that create this SN I material are not clear. Ram-pressure stripping and normal stellar mass loss are the two competing mechanisms for generating this SN I excess. We propose to observe the abundance gradient cluster A496 for 20 kseconds (ACIS-I) with the objective of discriminating between these two mechanisms for the contamination of the intracluster gas and determine the spatial extent of the gradient.
         932        1097 We are investigating a class of ROSAT X-ray source with extreme f_x/f_opt (>60). These bright sources (fx>10^-13cgs) have no optical counterparts on the Palomar Sky survey, hence we call them `Blank Field' X-ray sources. Deep optical imaging reveals candidates, but chance coincidences with ROSAT error circles are large at these magnitudes. Possibilities for the nature of blank field sources include: isolated neutron stars, `failed' clusters, and `diskless' quasars. AXAF has all the qualities needed to understand these unknown sources: accurate positions to nail the optical counterparts; CCD spectra to test neutron star (very soft) vs. cluster or AGN emission; and detailed imaging to distinguish clusters at any z. We propose short (10ksec) observations of the five best blank field sources.

         934        1313 We propose a multi-purpose observation of M101, a nearby face-on spiral galaxy with low foreground NH, fulfilling three goals: 1.) The study of the global distribution of diffuse coronal gas. The high resolution of the AXAF ACIS will allow removal of point sources to significantly deeper levels than possible with ROSAT. Thus we can obtain better measures of the diffuse gas at 1/4 keV and 3/4 keV, and place stronger limits on the existence of diffuse gas at 1.5 keV. 2.) The study of extended structures such as superbubbles, allowing resolution of structures on hundred parsec scales. 3.) The study of the distribution and luminosity functions of point sources, such as supernova remnants (~2.4e36 ergs/s), low-mass X-ray binaries (~2.8e36), and super-soft sources (~1.3e38).
         935        2371 The origin of the Cosmic X-ray background (CXB) has been one of the key issues of X-ray astronomy. We propose AXAF observations of 15 selected hard X-ray sources discovered by the serendipitous source survey project with ASCA. These sources have 2-10 keV fluxes below 5 x 10^(-13) erg/cm2/s. ASCA 0.7-2/2-10 keV counting rates that require them to either have power law photon indecies flatter than 1.0, or if they have intrinsic slopes of 1.7, have column density greater than Nh = 2 x 10^22/cm^2. For the determination of the nature of the 2-10 keV source population excellent X-ray positions are absolutely vital to obtain reliable identifications, in particular if one does not know a priori the nature of the optical objects.

We propose AXAF observations of 15 selected hard X-ray sources discovered by the serendipitous source survey project with ASCA. These sources have 2-10 keV fluxes below 5 x 10^(-13) erg/cm2/s. ASCA 0.7-2/2-10 keV counting rates that require them to either have power law photon indecies flatter than 1.0, or if they have intrinsic slopes of 1.7, have column density greater than Nh = 2 x 10^22/cm^2.

         942        2425 Observing X-ray shadows produced by neutral gas is the most direct way to decompose the soft X-ray background along a line of sight, therefore to tighten fundamental limits on various X-ray source populations and hot gas in the universe. Well-suited for such a shadowing experiment is the gas-rich, edge-on spiral NGC 4244, which is located in a direction of low Galactic X-ray absorption and is exceptionally inactive in star formation. The proposed ACIS observation of the galaxy will enable us to decompose the soft X-ray background in the 0.2-1 keV range into two separate components: Galactic and extragalactic. This decomposition is particularly important because it may provide a unique diagnosis of the thermal and chemical properties of the hot intergalactic medium.
         943         850 We propose to observe the nearby molecular cloud MBM 12, which shadows 70%-95% of the 3/4 keV (0.44-1.21 keV) diffuse background, in order to observe the foreground emission from O VII and O VIII at 0.57 and 0.65 keV. This will be the first-ever detection of an identifiable emission line from the Local Bubble. The O VIII/O VII ratio depends sensitively on the time since the gas was heated by a shock, and therefore determines the age of the Local Bubble. This observation will also help distinguish between models of the ISM dominated by hot or warm gas. If the Local Bubble is young (1e5 yrs) and already large, this suggests the ISM is filled with hot gas. If it is old (>1e6 yrs), then this would suggest bubbles do not break out and do not fill the ISM with hot gas.
         944        1151 With ASCA we found an extremely bright 6.4-keV line emitting region at the molecular cloud Sgr B2: the 6.4-keV island. X-ray spectrum, and spatial extensions of the island are consistent with those expected by X-ray irradiation on Sgr B2 from an outside source, hence may be called an X-ray reflection nebula: a new category of X-ray sources. Limited spatial resolution of ASCA, however, prevents us quantitative study on this interesting object. With superior resolving power of AXAF, we propose to study details on it. Main objectives are, (1) make further confirmation that Sgr B2 X-rays are really due to reflection of other X-ray source (s) and make a realistic picture of the reflection, (2) search for star forming activity, and (3) give strong constraint on the irradiating X-ray source(s).
         945        1676 Recent ASCA observations reveal the distribution of diffuse 2-10 keV continuum emission from the inner 0.2 deg of the Galactic center, in particular, a weak X-ray counterpart to the unusual radio Arc with their long 15 arcmin extent and narrow 5-10 arcsec width. The proposed AXAF observations of the Arc with ACIS-I will examine the nature of the association between radio filaments and the X-ray gas but also to study if the X-ray counterpart to the synchrotron radio filaments has any nonthermal characteristics in the X-ray. The correlative study between the X-ray and radio images has the potential to provide important clues on the nature of the acceleration of relativistic particles of the nonthermal filaments and on the nature of high energy activity at the Galactic center.
         946        2095 We have known for 15 years that globular clusters contain a population of faint (Lx < 10^35 erg/sec) X-ray sources in addition to a population of very bright low-mass X-ray binaries. Only the most luminous members of this faint source population have so far been detected, however, and their nature is still unclear. We propose a deep survey of 12 globular clusters to study this population at detection thresholds one to three orders of magnitude below those achieved previously. This will allow us to detect substantial numbers of binary systems of various kinds throughout the clusters. AXAF is ideally suited for this investigation: its combination of sensitivity and high spatial resolution is essential for studying these faint sources in their crowded environs.

         949        2300 Origin of the Galactic Ridge X-ray Emission (GRXE) is unknown yet. The most controversial issue is if GRXE is truly diffuse emission or composed of numerous point sources. The first imaging observation of GRXE above 2 keV with ASCA could not clearly answer to this question, being limited by the ASCA XRT spatial resolution (HPD~3 arcmin). With AXAF, having much superior spatial resolution, we will be unambiguously give the answer, being able to detect point sources with a luminosity of ~4x10^{32} erg s^{-1} at 10 kpc. If GRXE is truly diffuse emission, the interstellar magnetic reconnection is proposed as a mechanism to heat and confine the hot plasma. We may observe diffuse X-rays distribute along locally intensified magnetic fields, as observed in the Solar flares.
         950        2383 Dust particles in the interstellar medium have been observed to scatter X-rays to produce a halo. The detailed dependence of the halo, especially at small (< 100'') on energy and angular distribution is a function of the physical properties of the dust particles (size, composition) and the distribution of the dust along the line of sight. The angular and spectral resolution of AXAF will allow the determination of these parameters. We propose an initial survey of three sources: GX 13+1, Cir X-1, the O Star HD 148937. Analysis tools developed for this program will have important applicability to correct observations of highly `reddened' compact sources.
         951        2537 1H0253+193 is a hard X-ray source, situated by chance directly behind a dense nearby molecular cloud, MBM~12 (Lynds 1457). 1H0253+193 exhibits sharp, apparently complete, eclipses, lasting 1990~s and occuring every 21,800~s. These properties make this an ideal source for studying the size and chemical composition of interstellar grains via the temporal behavior of the X-ray flux resulting from dust scattering effects during the eclipse.
         952        2490 In many Type II supernovae (SNe), and some SN Ib/c, the interaction between the SN shock and the circumstellar material shed by the progenitor star creates a strong reverse shock that becomes extremely luminous in X-rays (> 10^39 erg/sec, 0.1-2.4 keV). The X-ray luminosity can be reasonably predicted by detecting the accompanying electron synchrotron radio emissions from the shocked regions. We propose AXAF ToO observations of selected categories of SNe to substantially increase the number of X-ray detections (currently at nine). Combined X-ray and radio observations will test theories of the shock mechanism and provide information on the SN progenitor. In addition X-ray spectra of the brighter SNe will constrain the physical properties of the reverse shock region and the SN ejecta.
