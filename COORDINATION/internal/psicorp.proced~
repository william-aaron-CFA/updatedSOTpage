REAL-TIME Telemetry_Process_Procedure with EHS HDR's. for FLIGHT Mar.1999
Editted by SJW after POP.
        
: This will be the official RT Telemetry Data Extractor Procedure to    
  be run from any CFA Server.
        

Step 1. Initialization

        : source .ascrc OR setascds

Step 2. Setup

        # create directories for telemetry indata/outdata.
        
        : mkdir MTA 
        : mkdir MTA/indata 
        : mkdir MTA/outdata


        # setenv Env varibles for ASCDS_TELEM (for directing or re-directing data flow)
        # by changing the env PORT to reflect where data is sent to that you want to 
        # intercept.
        # Chg env to reflect the PORT that Data is to be sent to:
        
        : setenv ASCDS_TELEM_MSGRCVR_PORT 11149
	(alternatives are 11249 - backup spacecraft data)
	(alternatives are 11150 - Primary SIM data)
	(alternatives are 11250 - backup SIM data)

        # Check to make sure env was set.
        : env |grep ASCDS_TELM
        
        ASCDS_TELEMTODARCH_MQ=230
        ASCDS_TELEM_NAME=telem
        ASCDS_TELEM_MSGRCVR_HOST=psicorp
        ASCDS_TELEM_MSGRCVR_PORT=11149
        ASCDS_TELEM_PWD=telem

        # Clean up shared memory from Last process run's
        : \rmipc -msq
        : ipcs
        # check for anything currently running

        : ps -auxwww | egrep "tph|pi" | egrep -v grep

        # Prepare to start telem_decomm
        : cd test_dir you want to run test from
        
        
Step 3. Initialization Run tph (Telemetry Packet Handler) via UDP to recieve
        data.

        # In window #1  start recieving telemetry data.
        # Note: before starting make sure env are set as described above.
        
        : start_telem_proc -d <directory to put output data> -flight -udp  (this cmd will allow all
          telem_decomm strippers/extractors to trigger. If you want a single stripper/extractor run
        : start_telem_proc -h (this is the help for strippers/extarctors, and to identify one or
          more to be triggered as desired.)
        # Then type the following:
        : start_telem_proc -d <directory to put output data> -flight -udp -ede (example of running
          one stripper/extractor. You can run as many on this cmd line as desired.)


Step 4. Monitor Processing  by way of top or top26
        : top 
        # Review the processing stack for validation of execution

Step 5. Monitor progress by reviewing data products being recv'd
        # goto directory in window #2 that products are being recv'd
        : cd <recv'd directory>
        : cd run
        # Review products generated
        : ls -ltr (View until NO more products)
                
Step 6. Kill processes when done

        # In window - 1 , do an ^up arrow til you find the start command.
        # then type ctrl A for backspacing to beginning. Then use cursor to change
        # word 'start' to 'stop' and hit return.
        # Review window with top and note processes being killed.
