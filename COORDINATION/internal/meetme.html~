<h1>SOT Meet-Me Facility</H1>

The context here is the normal science mission. <p>

The basic paradigm is for the scientists to be working in 
their own offices on their own workstations, which they
will have configured in standard ways to get access to data
and to use standard tools as desired, supplemented by 
custom configurations to use all other useful software.
Off-hours, they may be logged in remotely, or be only 
in voice contact. <p>

<h3> <li> General use </h3>
Harvard can set up a conference call with about 1/2 hour lead
time - cost:<br> 
$ 0.032 per minute for attended 800 meet me calls<br> 
$ 0.028 per minute for unattended 800 meet me calls<br> 
$ 0.018 per minute for toll meet me calls (each user pays for their own call
to the conference)<br> 


<H4> Details </H4>

To set up the conference call with an MCI teleconference operator you can
call 800-593-9900. Please use the Harvard University Authorization Code
"3961720V".
For billing purposes, the MCI operator will ask for the billing number -
the user should then provide the Harvard telephone number that the call
should be billed to (your number).<p>

You <em>do not</em> need to be on a Harvard phone to set this up!
You only need to know your office number- others phone may be anywhere.
Be sure to give the operator your office telephone number to 
bill.  The charges for each call will be processed through SAO's or 
HCO's normal telephone monthly billing system.<p>



<h3> <li> EMERGENCY USE ONLY - Future usage uncertain:</h3>
The OCC is setting up a very expensive 
instantanious Meet-me system. SOT may be able to use this 
in extreme emergancies. Further discussions are needed.

<!-- Primary is to use a meet-me line.  A SOT meet-me line is being
set up by Kathy Crowley as part of Marv LeBlanc's
full backup to the voice loops. This line is instantly 
available 24/7. One calls a toll-free number, and then 
enters a code. Multiple people can use speaker phones and
remain in communication while working at their terminal, (or
while at home, in transit, etc.). Voice contact or e-mail would
be used to get the desired people on the line. Cost is 
based on actual use, per line and per minute, currently at 
$0.34.  This is too expensive for continuous and routine use
(we would use normal office phones, e-mail, and face-to-face
for routine shift and daily status). For 10 significant anomalies
per year, 5 people each, on open phones for 10 hours, we would
be talking ~ $10K, which is half the cost of floor space for
a room (which doesn't exist anyway) in which we could work together.
