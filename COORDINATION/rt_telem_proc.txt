I. Normal operations configuration

   Normally, multimon runs on psicorp using the remotely accessible version.  
   This implementation of multimon is the primary implementation
   in nominal operations.  The remotely accessible version can be started and
   monitored from any workstation or from a remote site.
   The processes are monitored in realtime by
   the operators during normal shift hours.  The primary version
   of multimon is run under the account cxcds_rt.  
   
   Psicorp listens to realtime telemetry through port 11149.  Acorn
   WITH alarms is also run on this machine.
   
 1. To bring up multimon on psicorp:
 
     cxcds_rt on psicorp>setascds
     cxcds_rt on psicorp>cd /dsops/baseline/RT_raw #primary directory
     cxcds_rt on psicorp>multimon 15000 &
     cxcds_rt on psicorp>
    
     Now get back into multimon:

     cxcds_rt on psicorp>telnet psicorp 15000
     Multimon Login: cxcds_rt 
     Multimon Password: > ????? 
     multimon> stats 
     multimon> stats 

 Verify we are receiving packets. Idle time should be < 5 seconds. Packets in 
 and out should be increasing. 

     multimon> logout  

 This frees the port so you can check in again whenever you like.  


 You can use any port between 15000 and 15100.  Ports can get locked up if 
 multimon is brought down abruptly; it appears to take about 10 minutes for a
 port to become free again.  If you start up multimon and then are unable to 
 log in, it's possible that a lock-up has occurred--data is not being 
 distributed.  If that's the case, kill multimon and then start it again with
 the next higher port.   

     Make sure you are receiving data if we are AOS.  The realtime data
     will be written to /dsops/baseline/RT_raw, and L0 processing
     will automatically take place on psicorp.  Verify the file size
     of the most recent file is increasing

 In addition to checking the file size in /dsops/baseline/RT_raw, check 
 that the run directory in /dsops/GOT/realtime/L0/yyyymmdd is updating. If
 we're AOS, files should be written to that directory.  If we're LOS, only
 the systemlog should have a changing timestamp.  

 Should you need to add a port to multimon, use
     
	 add_udp_client <IP address> <port> <description>

     All new ports should be cleared with Joy first.   


 1.5  L0 decomm on psicorp: 

     realtime L0 data is sent to us from the GOT; we decomm it as it comes in 
     house.  To do this, run L0 on psicorp.  

	ssh2 -l ascdsops psicorp
	setascds
	mkdir  /dsops/GOT/realtime/L0/yyyymmdd	
	cd /dsops/GOT/realtime/L0/yyyymmdd
    	setenv ASCDS_TELEM_MSGRCVR_PORT 11110
	mkdir run
	cd run
	cp ~/huffstrip.ap .
	cd ..
	
     Check to make sure no other L0s are running on psicorp (there shouldn't be)
	
	ps -auxwww | grep "pi2" | egrep -v grep 

     Release the shared memory if necessary:

	ipcs -a
	rmipc -msq 

     Start up L0

	start_telem_proc -flight -udp -pi2Not -pi2r

     To stop, use stop_telem_proc.  Directories are switched every three days
     on average.  
	

 2. To bring up acorn with alarms:

 NOTE: Lisa would like this to be moved from the /tmp area, in case it
 fills up.  
     
     In another window, under the account cxcds_rt,
     
     # check whether there are files in /tmp/mtamail/in/*
     # If so, move them to /data/mta/MTA/mail_yyyymmdd/.

     cxcds_rt on psicorp> mv /tmp/mtamail/in/* /data/mta/MTA/mail_yyyymmdd

     # If not, make dir
     cxcds_rt on psicorp> mkdir -p /tmp/mtamail/in

     cxcds_rt on psicorp> setascds
     cxcds_rt on psicorp> start_mtaprs 300 # check once per 5 minutes
     cxcds_rt on psicorp> acorn -a -u 11100

 NOTE: When start_mtaprs is on, DO NOT RUN MTA_MONITOR_STATIC ON THAT MACHINE.
	NEVER RUN MTA_MONITOR_STATIC ON PSICORP.  This requirement should 
     eventually go away with a software update.   

 3. Safety net cron job
  
   If the multimon and/or acorn process goes down for any reason on
   psicorp, a cron job detects the absense of the process and immediately
   tries to restart it.  Note that if multimon goes down, another
   remotely accessible version of multimon will be automatically brought up in
   its place. When the cron job detects multimon and/or acorn have gone
   down and tries to restart them, an e-mail alert is generated to the
   CXCDS Ops staff.  Since the software is run on a remote machine
   (not psicorp) the email alert will be given if psicorp goes down.  The
   safety-net version of multimon is brought up under the account cxcds_rt.  
   
   A primary version of multimon should be brought back up at the first
   available time, when we are LOS.  The safety net version of
   multimon brought up autonomously may have trouble accepting logins.

   To kill the safety net version of multimon, 


   cxcds_rt on psicorp> telnet psicorp 15010 
   Multimon Login: cscds_rt
   Multimon Password: > *****
   multimon> shutdown

   It is also possible to kill it using kill -9 

   To turn off the cron job for a software update, 
	
	cxcds_rt on psicorp> crontab -e

   Find the line in this file that runs the cron job, and comment it out using
   '#'.  Save the file and exit the editor.  To turn it back on, remove the
   '#'.  
   

II. Hot backup 

    A hot backup of multimon is running constantly on forbin under the
    account cxcds_rt_bu.  This
    hot backup is configured identically to the multimon configuration
    on psicorp, with the following exception. The realtime data can be
    written to /dsops/GOT/baseline/rt_raw and the L0 processing can
    take place on forbin.  If psicorp goes down, and while 
    psicorp is up, all of psicorps services are mirriored (except data
    logging).  

    The only changes that have to take place if multimon is switched to
    the hot backup are:
    
    1. realtime data needs to be processed through L0.  If Ops is unable to 
       bring up L0 on forbin due to processing conflicts, L0 data can either
       be processed on another machine or simply stored to be processed later.  
	
    
    2. CXCDS Ops staff members insure no MTA_MONITOR_STATIC processes 
       are running on forbin (normally no MTA processing is run on this 
       machine).
         
    3. mtaprs needs to be started 
	(/home/cxcds_rt_bu/ACORN/acorn -au 11110 is running by default) 
       >mv /tmp/mtamail/in/* /data/mta/MTA/mail_yyyymmdd (clear out
		any alerts) 	
       >start_mtaprs 300 # check once per 5 minutes

!## We'd like this one to be automatic as part of the machine monitor 
!## software. 

    Once mtaprs is running on forbin, all MTA pipes should be brought down.  
    This requirement should eventually become redundant once the software fix
    is in place.  
       
    When the staff becomes aware that psicorp is down via the e-mail
    alert, the switch to forbin will take place immediately.  They then
    send e-mail to the realtime alias notifying everyone of the situation, 
    and contact the GOT to have the firewalls checked.  
       
    At the next LOS during staffed hours, the primary version of multimon
    is restarted on psicorp.  The switch should not been made unless there
    are at least six hours of LOS, to deal with possible start up problems.  
    Operations should make the switch from forbin to psicorp as soon as is
    feasible; there is no hot backup while we run realtime on forbin.  

    Mta_prs should be switched off on forbin when Ops transfers back to 
    psicorp.   
    
    If the switch from psicorp to forbin is triggered because firewall 1
    (OCCA) goes down, CXCDS Ops must wait for the firewall to be repaired
    before switching back to psicorp.  In this case OCCB may be
    recieving telemetry cold backups are available for this.
    
III. Cold backups  

    In addition the hot backup (forbin), there are two machines that can
    be used as cold backups (gamera and crosby).  Both of these machines
    have been configured to run as a multimon backup under the cxcds_rt_bu
    account, but multimon is NOT kept active on these machines under
    normal circumstances.  The only times the cold backups would be activated
    are :
    
    1. connection from OCCA to forbin and psicorp is down.
    2. both forbin and psicorp are down.
 
   If scenerio 1 is the case, we need to change the input port to
        multimon. Input ports should be PSICORP 11249  FORBIN  11251 (OCCB)

	procedure: 
 any account any machine > telnet psicorp 15000 #or whatever number was
						#typed after multimon above 
     Multimon Login: cxcds_rt 
     Multimon Password: >??????
     multimon> set_in_port 11249
     multimon> save
     multimon> shutdown

  (wait 10 minutes for the port to time out--this should no longer be a problem
  after the appropriate software fix is in place.)   

     cxcds_rt on psicorp> setascds
     cxcds_rt on psicorp> cd /dsops/baseline/RT_raw #primary directory
     cxcds_rt on psicorp> multimon 15000 &
     cxcds_rt on psicorp>
    
     Now get back in to multimon:

     cxcds_rt on psicorp>telnet psicorp 15000
     Multimon Login: cxcds_rt 
     Multimon Password: >??????
     multimon> stats 
     multimon> stats 

    verify we are receiving packets. Idle time should be < 5 seconds.  Packets
    in and out should be increasing.   

    multimon> logout  #this frees the port you can check in again
			whenever you like

   Do the same thing on forbin:
	
	> telnet forbin 15020
	Multimon Login: cxcds_rt_bu
	Multimon Password: > *****
	multimon> set_in_port 11251
	multimon> save
	multimon> shutdown

   Wait 10 minutes for the port to time out

	>cd /dsops/baseline/GOT/RT_raw
	>multimon 15020 &
	>telnet forbin 15020
	Multimon Login: cxcds_rt_bu
	Multimon Password: >*****
	multimon> stats
	multimon> stats

   Make sure we are receiving packets from OCCB
	
	multimon> logout

   Remember to undo this procedure when OCCA comes back on line. 


   If scenerio 2 is the case we need to run services with Gamera and
   Crosby sustituting for forbin and psicorp respectively.
   Input ports should be  Gamera  11153, CROSBY  11155. 

	crosby> cd /dsops/baseline/RT_raw
	crosby> multimon 15030 &
	crosby> telnet crosby 15030 
	Multimon Login: cxcds_rt
	Mutlimon Password: >*****
	multimon> stats
	multimon> stats

   Verify data is coming in on port 11155 on crosby.  

   Set up mta_prs and acorn with alarms on crosby:
	crosby> ls /tmp/mtamail/in/*
        #! if there are files present, move them to 
	/data/mta/MTA/mail_yyyymmdd.  If not, make the directory:

	crosby> mkdir -p /tmp/mtamail/in
	crosby> setascds
	crosby> start_mtaprs 300
	crosby> acorn -a -u 11100

   Once mta_prs is running, DO NOT RUN MTA ON CROSBY.  This will require that
   AutoMAP be either shut down or modified for the duration of the incident,
   since MTA is kicked off automatically using this software.  The requirement
   will be let go once the needed software update is in place.   


	gamera> cd /dsops/GOT/baseline/RT_raw
	gamera> multimon 15040 &  
        gamera> telnet gamera 15040
	Multimon Login: cxcds_rt_bu
	Multimon Password: > *****
	multimon> stats
	multimon> stats

   Verify data is coming in on port 11153 on gamera.  

   If scenerios 1 & 2 are both active need to run services with Gamera and
         Crosby sustituting for forbin and psicorp respectively.
         Input ports should be  Gamera  11253, CROSBY  11255

	crosby> cd /dsops/baseline/RT_raw
	crosby> multimon 15030 &
	crosby> telnet crosby 15030
	Multimon Login: cxcds_rt
	Multimon Password:> ***
	multimon> set_in_port 11255
	multimon> save
	multimon> shutdown

   Wait ten minutes for the port to time out, and then

	crosby> cd /dsops/baseline/RT_raw
	crosby> multimon 15030 &
	crosby> telnet crosby 15030
	Multimon Login: cxcds_rt
	Multimon Password:> ****
	multimon> stats
	multimon> stats 

   Make sure the number of packets in is increasing.  

   Set up acorn with alarms on crosby:

	crosby> ls /tmp/mtamail/in/*
        #! if there are files present, move them to
        /data/mta/MTA/mail_yyyymmdd.  If not, make the directory:

        crosby> mkdir -p /tmp/mtamail/in
        crosby> setascds
        crosby> start_mtaprs 300
        crosby> acorn -a -u 11100

   Once mtaprs is running on crosby, DO NOT RUN MTA ON CROSBY.  

   Also set up gamera:

	gamera> cd /dsops/GOT/baseline/RT_raw
	gamera> multimon 15040 &
	gamera> telnet gamera 15040
	Multimon Login: cxcds_rt_bu
	Multimon Password:> *****
	multimon> set_in_port 11253
	multimon> save
	multimon> shutdown

   Wait ten minutes until the port times out, and then

	gamera> cd /dsops/GOT/baseline/RT_raw
	gamera> multimon 15040 &
	gamera> telnet gamera 15040
	Multimon Login: cxcds_rt_bu	
	Multimon Password:> *****
	multimon> stats
	multimon> stats 


   There should be no software collision between realtime and regular processing
   once MTA_STATIC is modified to read from another directory, as has been 
   discussed.  When either the hot or cold backups are activated, it not 
   not necessary to run L0 on the realtime data from those machines.  
    
   Obviously, the switch to one of the cold backups is expected to be
   very rare and would require an unusual set of circumstances.
