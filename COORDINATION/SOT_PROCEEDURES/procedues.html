If the problem is serious enough you would get paged with this data
(hence the cryptic form).  Such a page requires a reply withing five
minutes or the page is resent.
(simply reply to the page, this is easy with the skytels on order,
impossible with the motorolas).


<LI> 
in the case of event data, no automated errors get reported.
To report an error
email the following to mtadude@head-cfa.harvard.edu, cc swolk
