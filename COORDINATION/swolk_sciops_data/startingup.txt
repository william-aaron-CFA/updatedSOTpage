Hi all,
It is time to start up MTA alerts.
The plan is to to this SLOWLY!


QUESTION:
who moves this process through data system?
who moves this process through CCB?



Phase A  must be completed by DAY 224 (August 10)
Only send alerts for safe mode entry detected by realtime.

step 1 patch MTA software with:
new ARD

acorn_pipe_group.list
acorn_pipe_process.list 
email.list

(these are currently in /proj/ascds/swolk/www/swolk_sciops_data)

Step 2 add the following to the flight release 
tlmt.txt file in the IPCL

"CCSDSTMF,1,-30.0,4.1,-20.0,4.5.,,5,"A";

i.e any thing above format 4(.5) is a red violation.



step 3
on the machine runing the realtime version of acorn -a
bring down acorn
>start_mtaprs
>acorn -a -uXXXXX (no other flags)


PHASE 2  must be completed by TBD
Bring well behaved on line via REALTIME


PHASE 3  must be completed by DAY 264 - (sept 22?)
Bring well behaved systems on line via AP.

PHASE4....
