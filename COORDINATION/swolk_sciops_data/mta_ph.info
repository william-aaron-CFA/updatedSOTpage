		Monitoring and Trends Analysis (MTA) Help Information



	Welcome to the MTA Data Inspector written using Interactive Data Language 
(IDL) 5.0 (http://www.rsinc.com).  The current version of this tool will allow users
to make strip plots, 3D visualizations, and perform simple analysis of data and if
possible save hardcopies.  We refer to all our tools as gadgets.

	The Pull Down Menu (PDM) heirarchy is described below. The inactive menus 
can be identified via a -, a + denotes an working menu selection, and a * represents
a class.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
o File

  + Open
  ------
	This PDM allows the user to open a FITS file.  The current version of this 
	tool only handles flat FITS files (i.e. the columns are scalar).

  + Expressions
  -------------
	This PDM calls the Expression Generation Gadget, also know as the EGG.  The
	EGG combines the flexibility of an IDL command line and access to the classes
	data wrapped in a nice widget based shell. The EGG will allow the user to 
	perform any operation upon the data choosen.  The operations are not limited
	to *, /, +, -, or %, but any operation can be performed upon the data.

	This gadget also allows the user to create their own data using standard 
	IDL commands.

	FUTURE UPGRADES:  Allowing this Class to be called in a non interactive mode
			  so that operations can be performed in an automatic 
			  pipeline style.

	CAUTION:  	  STILL IN TESTING PHASE

  + Set Filter(s)
  ---------------
	This PDM will call the MTA Filter Class and allow the user to define what
	string filers can be applied.

	DEFAULT FILTERS:	'time','_'

	FUTURE UPGRADES:  We expect to add both filter and mask ability to this tool.
 

  + File Info
  -----------
	This PDM will return the file information for each file that has been loaded.
	

  + Show Mnemonics
  ----------------
	Print a list of the mnemonics to the screen.  

	FUTURE UPGRADES:  Fix format problems when mnemonic name lengths are uneven.

  + Exit
  ------
	Exit the Data Inspector

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
o Viewers

  + Strip plots - OD   (OBJECT - DRAW)
  ------------------
	This PDM will call the MTA xplot Class which uses the object draw ability
	of IDL 5.0.  This gadget is will open two widget bases: 1) A nonexclusive 
	mnemonic list (select what you want plotted), and 2) A draw window in which
	the plots are drawn.  This class also has the neat feature of zooming in on 
	data.  By clicking on the upper left corner of your desired zoom box and
	dragging the mouse to the lower right corner you can zoom in on the data. A
	red selection box is drawn over the region you have selected to show what 
	region has been selected.

	DISADVANTAGES:	 object graphics to slow!
		
	FUTURE UPGRADES:	? ? ?	


  + Strip plots - DD (DIRECT - DRAW)
  ------------------
	This PDM will call the MTA plot Class which uses the direct draw ability
	of IDL 5.0.  This gadget is will open a widget base that contains: A 
	nonexclusive mnemonic list (select what you want plotted), a draw window
	in which the plots are drawn, min/max sliders, window size (x,y amplifiers),
	plot columns and plot row 

	CMTAPLOT PDMs:
	  o FILE:	 
	  -------
		- Open:
		+ Save ad GIF:
			 This PDM will allow users to save their plot as a GIF.  A
			 pickfile dialog box is opened and queries for a filename.
		 	 DEFAULT FILENAME = tmp.gif
		+ Print: Save view as color PS file.
		- Print setup: 
		- Exit:  Exit the Strip Plot gadget.

	  o INFORMATION:
	  --------------
		+ About:
		+ Help:


	ADVANTAGES:	 Direct-Draw graphics faciliates storing to output (PS, GIF,
			 PS, etc.)

	DISADVANTAGES:	 Not as powerful as object graphics.
		
	FUTURE UPGRADES:   1) The MTA Class is also able to be used in a Non
			   interactive mode. 2) Increase Fitting capabilties. 3)
			   increase diversity of colors, linestyles, psyms, for	
			   overplotting.

  - XY Correlation:   NO TOOL YET
  ----------------

  - Images:  NO TOOL YET
  --------
	View / Analyize Image data

	FUTURE UPGRADES:  Write tools that handle files seperately or rewrite the
	 		   MTA File class which handles the flat FITS files.  
			   Incorporate other SW.

  + 3-D
  -----
	This PDM calls the MTA 3D visualization class.  This class which utilizes
	IDL 5.0s object draw allows the user to plot 3 mnemonics verse one another
	and rotate the plot in 3D viewing it from any possible angle.  Upon being
	created a mock data set is displayed using a RGYB color cycle.  This is 
	only for asthetic quality and does NOT represent data status.

	o FILE:  This PDM will allow the users to perform the following commands
	------
	     PRINT:  Save view as EPS file.
	     PRINT SETUP: Setup the printing format.
	     SAVE AS:	Save view as GIF, TIFF, or JPEG image.  Def. name = idl.ext.
	     EXIT:	Exit the 3D viewer.

	o COLORS: This PDM will allow the users to modify the colors of the view and
	--------   uses the following colors. (Black,Blue,Green,Yellow,Red, White)

	    DATA: Change data color: Standard colors, Cyclic, other(Not funct.).
	    AXIS: Change axes color:  Standard colors.
	    BACKGROUND: Change background color: Standard colrs.
	    Default:  Default colors are white background, black axes, and RGYB 
			cyclic data.

	o STYLE: This PDM will allow the users to modify how the data are 
	-------   represented.
	    LINESTYLES: Change the linestyle of the data.
		(solid, dotted, dash, dash-dot, dash-dot-dot, etc.)

	    SYMBOLS:    Change the Symbol type of the data.
		(plus, asterisk, period, diamond, square, X)


	+ Data Selection Droplists [X:,Y:,Z:]  
	    These droplists allow the user to choose the data for a given axis 
	     from a list of possible mnemonics.

	+ View Orientation buttons:  Sometimes an axis label will dissappear.  This
		is a known feature and a fixed is being desigened for the future.

		   XY Plane:	View the X-Y plane.
		   YZ Plane:	View the Y-Z plane.
		   XZ Plane:	View the X-Z plane.
		   XYZ Original Orientation:   Return to the original orientation
						 of the data set.

	
	DRAW BACKS:  Slow, but not outrageously slow.

	ADVANTAGES:  Trackball capability to rotate the data.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
o Analysis

  + No Limits status
  ------------------
	Return min, max, average, std. dev., # Red violations, # Green violations,
	# Yellow violations, # Blue violations, # total points for each mnemonic.

  + Limits status
  ------------------
	Return min, max, average, std. dev. for each mnemonic.

  + FLAG FLight Aca egse Gadget
  -----------------------------
	This PDM will call the MTA ACA Class which will create the FLAG which is 
	comprised of four basic seperate classes: 1) Images Class, 2) Image_map,
	3) Table, 4) Control_Panel.  No data are passed from the DI to the Flag so
	all data must be opened manually.

	SLOT:  Integer 0-7 identifying the image slot
	TYPE:	Raw 		- Raw Image         (L0 data product)
		Corr		- Corrected Image   (L1 product)
		Resid		- Residuals between (fit and Corr) (L1 product)
		None		- No Image selected (EMPTY IMAGE)

	* FLAG:  This class wraps, controls and connects the four basic classes.
	------
		+ FILE
		------
		  + OPEN
		  ------
		      This PDM allows users to open FITS files.  When a ACA L0 FITS
		      file is selected the code looks for eight files 
		      <time_stamp>_img_0.fits.  Currently this is the ONLY naming
		      convention available for FITS files.  This gadget can also
		      handle previous IDL save sets which are currently created only
		      upon opening a valid set of FITS files.  The default file name
		      is data.dat.

		  + EXIT
		   ------
		      This PDM will cleanup the FLAG and exit.
		
	* TABLE:  This class controls the ascii image viewer.
	-------
		Slot:  Slot ID (see above)
		Type:  Image Type (see above)


	* IMAGES:  This class controls scaling, range, and type od data shown in 
  	--------   the ACA Image slot views.  The images, even though they maybe
		   4x4, 6x6, or 8x8 pixel images, are all drawn as 8x8 images.  The
		   extra space is filled in with blue background to help identify
		   the image sizes.  Fid images are shown in a red scale and stars
		   are shown in a gray scale.


		SCALE[0-7]: Scaling factor for Slots.
		Image Type:  (see above)
		Time:	T [Current Time], T+1 [Index of Current Time+1],
			T+2 [Index of Current Time +2]
		Scale: Scaling applied to image (Linear, Log (alog10), Sqrt)
		Min:   Minimum Point of prescaled Image (default = min of image)
		Max:   Maximum of prescaled Image (default = max of image)
		
		Auto Scaling: Control Slot Image scaling factors.
			On:  Automatically set the scaling factors 
			     for each tier
			Off: Shut off autoscaling.
			Reset: resets Scale[0-7] to 1.00

		Min/Max Reset: Control min/max scaling for each/all tiers
				 [Tier 1, Tier 2, Tier 3, All Tiers].
			

	* IMAGE_MAP:  This class controls the details for the slot position viewer
	-----------   which reveals where on the 1K chip the slots were obtained 
		      from.  FID lights are represented as red boxes and stars are
		      identified as white asterisks.  The slot number is placed on
		      the inner most corner of the position.  The history 
		      information is shown as blue dots.


		History: 	   - Show position history [On/Off].
		History Amplifier: - Amplify star movements since the display is
					undersamples by 4x.
		 	* NOT IMPLEMENTED AS OF YET. Planned for release 
			   before flight.

	* CONTROL_PANEL:  This class controls the mode of operation, the current 
	---------------	  time, play mode and speed of play.
	
		MODE:		- Play mode [ONLINE, OFFLINE]
				  offline: open files manually
				  online:  runs automatically opening files when
					    end of previous file has been reached.
				* CURRENTLY only OFFLINE mode works.  ONLINE is
				  slatted to be released before FLIGHT.
	
		INPUT FILE:  	- File name (full path) of file currently open. 

		START TIME:	- start time for data in current file. Not editable.
		STOP TIME: 	- stop time for data in current file. Not editable.

		CURRENT TIME:	- Current time for data of time T begin displayed.
				  editable.

		PLAY MODE:	|<		- Rewind to beginning of data
			  	<<		- Rewind one index
				<Play		- Play Backwards
				Stop		- STOP
				Play>		- Play forwards
				>>		- Fastforward one index
				>|		- FF to end of data
	
		PLAY SPEED:	Controls the number of 0.3 second intervals during
				which the S/W pauses. Allowing the S/W to run slower
				on faster machines.

				0 -> faster play speed (0 sec. wait)
				9 -> slowest play speed (9 sec. wait)

  + HRMA Visualization Gadget (NOT YET INCLUDED).
  ---------------------------
	This gadget will allow users to look at a section of
	the HRMA [FAP, CAP, etc.] and see the highest violation, determine gradients,
	as well as look at individual strip plots for each thermistor or even an
	over plot of all thermistors for a section.
