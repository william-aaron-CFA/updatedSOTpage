This is a list of the highest priority M&TA tasks. 
There is no prioritization given within the list because I feel that
this list give the minimum that we must be capable of by September in
order to demonstrate that we have a basic understanding of the overall
spacecraft and the data flow.  The are 39 tasks in the list, not
including 5 HRC tasks which will probably be done but won't be needed
nor several ACIS tasks which require ground commanding and are not
relevant to the first set of test.  My biggest concern is still
databases.   Many of the PCAD tools take
their limits from the OCAT, others rely on limits from the CAL
database. I am willing to ``stub'' these values for September.  
But we must be able
to access our own database.  I still feel June is the deadline for
seeing how this will work.  So this means we must learn how to do it
in April.

It may appear from this list that we are
simply duplicating what is already being done at OCC.  That is not
true.  The selected item were chosen because of there straightforward
nature.  None of the ACIS tasks, and none of the HRC or PCAD imaging
tasks is capable of being performed at the OCC.  Also the data at the
OCC are not under ASC control.  As the lessons of XRCF have taught us,
control of our data is critical to understanding its meaning. Finally,
none of the 90 or so additional tasks, required by flight are covered
by the OCC.  Where there is overlap in the monitoring it is needed to
cover a flight trending need.The corollary is that the ~80 tasks to be written in the 6 months
from Sept. through Feb.  are far more complex than the 39 being written in
the six months between now and September.


This is very much a minimum list.  The fact of the matter remains that
ASC is required to deliver fully functional software capable of monitoring and
trending all items in the Carilli book by the February end to end test.
We expect to spend from February through August putting the software
through its paces, fully understanding it, identifying and correcting
weaknesses, and making it flight worthy.

ACIS  -

Most of the ACIS tasks are done by the ACIS as it can be directed via
ground based commands.  Operationally a command is issued to collect
the data.  M&TA simply receives and checks the data.  These tasks may
not be commanded during I&T in September but certainly will be in
February.  All but 241, 247 and 2410 could  be put at slightly lower
priority. (that leaves 39 at top priority).

HRC
All the task here are part of the trial development thread.
So I expect them to exist soon. However, 3.1-3.4 concern the detector
which is not to be exposed in the first test.  So they are NOT needed
