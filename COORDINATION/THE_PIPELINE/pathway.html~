<h1> M&TA Data Processing </h1>

<hr>
<FONT COLOR=#00FFFF SIZE=4>
This page currently a first attempt to flesh out the daily processing 
to be carried out by M&TA Hardware and software. Software tasks break
themselves into three types:
<li> Those which act on and output Raw or standard data products.
<li> Those which act on standard data products and output
an MTA product.
<li> Those which act on an MTA product.
</FONT>

An earlier form of this plan from <a href = "../1997_plan/index.htm" >
1997 </a> is also available.<br>

<h3> Outline of processing</h3>

<h4>  Act on and output Raw or standard data products.</h4>
<ol>
<li><FONT COLOR=#00FFFF SIZE=3>ACORN/MTA-RT</FONT> - This is an MTA
specialty tool for monitoring the Real-time data. Limits are sensed
based on the ODB.
<ul>
<li> <FONT COLOR=#00FFFF SIZE=2>Input</FONT> - The UDP real-time
stream from DSN.

<li> <FONT COLOR=#00FFFF SIZE=2>Output</FONT> - Messages to the Notifier.
</ul>

<li><FONT COLOR=#00FFFF SIZE=3>MTA/SDP</FONT> - This is the MTA
version of AP running under separate instantiation than the flight
pipeline.  It contains the following:
<ul> 

<li><FONT COLOR=#00FFFF SIZE=2>DECOM</FONT> - This is 
Similar to flight DECOM creating all L0 data products. The difference
is in handling partial obsids.  In the case of MTA L0 ACIS and HRC
shall create close L0 event files based on the best guess of
spacecraft parameters.<FONT COLOR=#FF00FF > Question: Are the ACIS/HRC
event files cumulative or just data from the last pass?</FONT>

<li><FONT COLOR=#00FFFF SIZE=2>L0.5/ACIS/HRC Closeout</FONT>
This is meant to capture any time required to create the non archive
ACIS/HRC temporary L0 files, Plus time to create any needed L0.5
files. <i> I don't think MTA needs these. </i>

<li><FONT COLOR=#00FFFF SIZE=2>L1/OBI</FONT>Based on the L0 event
product MTA should use something like the SI-pipe to generate a  
<em> per pass </em> events list.  MTA should also use the Archival L1
event lists and ACA products as sources of future Monitoring.

<li><FONT COLOR=#00FFFF SIZE=2>CELL DETECT</FONT> MTA will have to run
its own form of Cell detect on all L1 event files (except for
gratings).  This will be done only on the archival L1 products.

<li><FONT COLOR=#00FFFF SIZE=2>L1.5 - Gratings</FONT> MTA has a
specific suite of procedures be executed against gratings L1 or L1.5 
files.
</ul>
</ol>

<h4> Act on standard data products and output an MTA product.</h4>
<ol>
<li><FONT COLOR=#00FFFF SIZE=3>Static Monitor</FONT> - This is the MTA
<A HREF="http://hea-www.harvard.edu/~sopdev/mta/pipes/monitor_static.ps">
Standard Monitoring</A>. 
<ul>
<li> <FONT COLOR=#00FFFF SIZE=2>Primary Input</FONT> - L0 engineering like data of msids which are not
context or state dependent.<em> OR </em> L1 data from ASPECT or other pipes
which calculate static values useful to monitor.

<li> <FONT COLOR=#00FFFF SIZE=2>Secondary Input </FONT> - Group.list,
process.list, Limits.db, Email.list.

<li> <FONT COLOR=#00FFFF SIZE=2>Output</FONT> - Data for use by
notifier, fits file for use by Summary page maker, fits file for use
by DB ingest.
</ul>
<li><FONT COLOR=#00FFFF SIZE=3>Dynamic/State Monitor</FONT> - This is the MTA
<A HREF="http://hea-www.harvard.edu/~sopdev/mta/pipes/monitor_state.ps">
State sensitive monitoring</A>.  Really this is a front end to the
static pipe which updates the limits database with time variability
information.  This pipeline is  designed to monitor those
values which are sensitive to the actual state of the spacecraft.
<em> Whether or not the spacecraft was in the expected state requires
comparison against the OBSCAT. Therefore we consider that test a V&V
task.</i>

<ul>
<li> <FONT COLOR=#00FFFF SIZE=2>Primary Input</FONT> - L0 engineering like data of msids which are context or state dependent.

<li> <FONT COLOR=#00FFFF SIZE=2>Secondary Input </FONT> - Group_list,
process_list, Var_Limits.db, Email_list.

<li> <FONT COLOR=#00FFFF SIZE=2>Output</FONT> - Data for use by
notifier, fits file for use by Summary page maker, fits file for use
by DB ingest.
</ul>

<li><FONT COLOR=#00FFFF SIZE=3>Photon_mon/ACIS_CCD_mon/HRC_dose</FONT> -
This trio of tools have similar goals for variable data.
<ul>
<li><a href =" ../specs/photon_mon.ps">Photon_mon</a> creates a quick look at the focal plane and certain PHA
data and hot pixels..
<li><a href =" ../specs/acis_ccd_mon.ps">ACIS_CCD_mon</a> looks more carefully at the PHA distributions node by
node/FEP by FEP as a precursor to CTI.
<li><a href =" ../specs/hrc_dose.ps">HRC_dose</a> looks for over-exposure of the HRC using L1 event data.
</ul>
<ul>
<li> <FONT COLOR=#00FFFF SIZE=2>Primary Input</FONT> - L0 or L1 event lists
(HRC_dose requires L1 event list + bad pixel list).  For these tools 
we use both the non archival (SI-Pipe?) and archival L0 and L1
products on an as available basis.  In other words... When the 8 pass
ends we have 8+ hours of a 50 hours observation, we run Photon_mon and
ACIS_CCD_mon against the incomplete L0 file.  We also process the L0
file through SI-PIPE and run HRC_dose, Photon_mon and ACIS_CCD_mon
against the L1 output of SI pipe.  These output go to a quick-look web
page.  When the archival quality L0 and L1 Products are available,
they are run through the same tools, the output goes the the permanent
MTA OBI display page. <i> Note - when I use the term archival quality
I mean data in or scheduled to go in the archive, I intend that the
process run off the cache data </i>. 

<li> <FONT COLOR=#00FFFF SIZE=2>Output</FONT> - Data for use by
notifier, fits file for use by html page maker (done internally), 
fits file to be archived (except in the case of Photon_mon - no archive).
</ul>

<li><FONT COLOR=#00FFFF SIZE=3>ACA_MON</FONT> - This is an MTA
<a href =" ../specs/aca_mon.ps">specialty tool</a> to monitor the output of the aspect Level 1 pipe.
<ul>
<li> <FONT COLOR=#00FFFF SIZE=2>Primary Input</FONT> - Archival
quality L1 FIDPROPS,
ACACENT and GSPROPS FILES.

<li> <FONT COLOR=#00FFFF SIZE=2>Secondary Input </FONT> -  Limits.db, Email_list.

<li> <FONT COLOR=#00FFFF SIZE=2>Output</FONT> - Data for use by
notifier, data for internal Summary page maker, possible data for DB
(probably handled by ACA_TRD)
</ul>

<li><FONT COLOR=#00FFFF SIZE=3>Grat_mon</FONT> - This is an MTA
specialty tool (specification due 3/31 - pseudo-code (IDL) is
available) to monitor the Gratings data.
<ul>
<li> <FONT COLOR=#00FFFF SIZE=2>Primary Input</FONT> - Archival quality
L1.5 tg events file.

<li> <FONT COLOR=#00FFFF SIZE=2>Output</FONT> - Data for use by
notifier, data for internal summary page maker, possible data for DB
(unspecified).

</ul>

<li><FONT COLOR=#00FFFF SIZE=3>Src_mon</FONT> - This is an MTA
specialty tool (specification due 3/31) to monitor the focus.
We will apply our own version of cell detect to the L1 data and act on
the result.
<ul>
<li> <FONT COLOR=#00FFFF SIZE=2>Primary Input</FONT> - Archival
quality L1 events file.

<li> <FONT COLOR=#00FFFF SIZE=2>Output</FONT> - Data for use by
notifier, data for internal summary page maker, possible data for DB
(unspecified).
</ul>
</ol>
<h4> Act on an MTA product.</h4>
The following tools take final action on MTA Products and tend to have
a life of their own.
<ol>
<li><FONT COLOR=#00FFFF SIZE=3>Notifier</FONT> - A.K.A. MTA_PRS.
This tool sends problem messages to pagers, email accounts and the 
problem tracker.  It also needs to receive replies to the pager
messages. This software requires its own account: <i> MTADUDE</i> is
currently used.

<li><FONT COLOR=#00FFFF SIZE=3>Mk_sum_pg</FONT> - This is a generic
name for an activity carried out by many pipelines of converting their
data to web pages and embedded gifs. 

<li><FONT COLOR=#00FFFF SIZE=3>Population of MTA DB Tables</FONT> -
This activity should occur at the end of most MTA activities which act
on archival quality products.  Those data which have been acted on
which are also in the <a href="../MTA_DATABASES.txt">MTA DB tables</a>
(15 are define 5 more are coming) should be ingested to the
appropriate tables.
</ol>

<h4> Out of loop MTA Activities.</h4>
The following MTA activities are not directly tied to OBSIDs are to
the spacecraft directly.  So they can be scheduled independently.

<ol>
<li><FONT COLOR=#00FFFF SIZE=3>Trends</FONT> -
The current plan is to run trends on a 1/subsystem/week basis.  Monday
ACIS, Tuesday PCAD, etc.  The plan is to use the Data_seeker version
1.0 acting on the MTADB tables. The software would execute each
morning from 3-7 a.m. local time.

<li><FONT COLOR=#00FFFF SIZE=3>Concatenation and archive of *STATIC
and *STATE FITS files.</FONT> - Currently MTA generates Hundreds of
these files per day. Basically 1 of each type of file / hour in
formats 1 and 2. So we have code to concatenate the 24-84 files for a
given subsystem into 1 file.  We would prefer to archive only that
file. This activity could be execute by cron job and occur from 12:30
to 3 a.m. local time.

<li><FONT COLOR=#00FFFF SIZE=3>Problem Tracking</FONT> - MTA problem
tracking currently runs outside of the ops structure.
The software receives email and restricted web input to track problem
status. This software requires its own account: <i> MTA </i> is
currently used.
