This directory contains CSS Stylesheets for MTA web pages.

Note that many legacy HTML pages reference stylesheets in their local directories or have a style sheet hard-coded into their HTML file.

Please create all future CSS style sheets in this repository for use in future webpages.

If it is desired for a legacy webpage to have its stylesheet altered beyond simple changes within the local HTML file, please use a symbolic link pointing towards this CSS_STYLE directory for the new CSS stylesheet.

Please comment dates next to changes in stylesheet references to keep track of when changes occur
