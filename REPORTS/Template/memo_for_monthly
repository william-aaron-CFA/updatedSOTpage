a month long and the entire mission tables are found in:
/data/mta/Script/Exposure/Exc 
after 3rd of every month (I need to compute manually on the 3rd).

Other Part:

if the line says <!-- UPDATE -->, the name of the file must be updated to the month of report.

if the line says <!-- REPLACE -->, you do not need to change the name on the line, but get a new
file(s) for the input.

if the line says <!-- UPDATE/REPLCE --> you need to update the name, and obtain a new file.


put the comment <!--  --> around the last month's option report part.
un comment this month's report option part.
